III. ORTHOGRAPHY. xlvii

ΙΙΙ. ORTHOGRAPHv1.

The increased knowledge of MSS. and inscriptions which the
present century (one might almost say, the present generation)
has brought forth makes it impossible for any editor of a Latin
classic to profess either ignorance or disregard of disputed questions
in Latin orthography, or to acquiesce in the established spelling
which satisfied our grandfathers. Barbarisms such as ‘coelum,'
‘coena‚² ‘lacryma,² ‘sylva,' ‘moereo,' introduced by the Italian
scholars of the Renaissance ‘to derive those words preposterously
from the Greek,' are by this time almost unanimously discredited :
but there are many other words, on the spelling of which the
evidence of MSS. and inscriptions is practically conclusive, which
continue to greet us in their wrong dress. The following is a
representative, though not complete, list of such words :—

Ι. Words as to which MSS. and Inscriptions are unanimous, or
nearly so :—

(a) ‘Querella,' ‘loquella,' ‘sollemnis,' ‘Juppiter,’ ‘littera,' ‘quat-
tuor,' ‘bracchium,’ ‘damma,' ‘ammentum ;' ‘baca,' ‘belua‚³
‘conecto‚’ ‘coniti‚' ‘conubiu1n‚⁷ ‘litus,’ ‘milia,⁷ ‘paulum,’ ‘religio,²
‘ reliquiae.’

(b) ‘Condicio,' ‘dicio‚' ‘solacium,' ‘ocius;' ‘nuntius,⁷ ‘setius,'
‘autumnus’

(c) ‘Umerus,’ ‘um0r‚' ‘umidus ;’ ‘erus,’ ‘erilis 3³ ‘harena,’ ‘ha-
rundo,' ‘haruspex‚' ‘hedera’ (also ‘edera’?), ‘Hiberus,⁷ ‘Hister,'
‘ aenus ’ (‘ ahenus ⁷), ‘ incohare.'

(d) ‘Adicere,' ‘conicere,⁷ ‘deicere,' and so all compounds of
‘iacio,’ except ‘disiicere' (? ‘ dissicere '), [some good MSS. however
give ‘proiicit,' ‘deiicit' or ‘deiecit' (see on Ecl. iii. 96), and it is
not clear that ‘ deicit,' etc. were universal in Virgil's time].

(e) ‘n’ before ‘ d' in ‘quendam,' ‘eundem,’ etc. ; but ‘circumdo‚'
‘iamdudum3' ‘m' before ‘q’ in ‘quemquam,⁷ ‘tamquam,' ‘um—
quam :' ‘nequiquam.'

(s) ‘Caelum‚’ ‘caenum,' ‘caespes,' ‘faenum,⁷ ‘foedus,’ ‘frena,'
‘ glaeba,' ‘ scaena' (‘ scena ²), ‘proelium,' ‘ saepes :' ‘ cena,⁷ ‘ ceteri,'
‘femina‚’ ‘fenus,’ ‘levis,' ‘obscenus,’ ‘ silva,² ‘Vergilius'
