xxxviii INTROD UCTION.

1. VERRIUS FLACCUS,¹ a learned freedman of the time of Au-
gustus and tutor to the Emperor⁷s nephews, wrote a lexicogra-
phical work ‘De Verborum Significatu⁷ alphabetically arranged,
in which he quoted extensively from Virgil. This we possess in
an abridgement made by Festus in the 2nd century A.D.,
which seems to have superseded the original work, and to have
been in its turn superseded by the epitome of its contents made in
the time of Charlemagne by one Paulus, a priest. The work of
Festus exists in only one MS. of the 11th century; that of Paulus
in several of the loth and 11th‚ and one said to be of the 9th.
Later lexicographers‚ such as Nonius Marcellus (see below),
and commentators, such as Servius (p. xxx.) probably drew largely
from the work of Verrius, which was so rich a storehouse of infor-
mation that repeated diluting and abridging could not efface all
its original wealth.

2. AULUS GELLIUS (A.D. 125-175)‚ author of ‘Noctes Atticae,' a
discursive work on nurnberless points of interest in literature and
language and religious or antiquarian lore, with many literary and
historical an'ecdotes, and great wealth of quotation, sometimes
from lost authors : but Virgil and Cicero seem to have won his chief
admiration. On the whole he is trustworthy‚ and has a sound
judgment3 and he is sreely used (generally without acknow-
ledgement) by later writers, especially Macrobius. A few of his
Chapters on Virgilian learning are i. 23 ; ii. 3, 4; ν. 8; νί. 6; vii.
12, 20; ix. 9; x. 163 xiii. 1, 20.

3. NoNius MARCELLUS (end of 3rd cent. A.D.), a native of
Africa, wrote a lexicographical work, or commonplace book,
‘Compendiosa Doctrina per literas,' on various subjects lin-
guistic and antiquarian, which, though ill-arranged and uncritical‚
is valuable for its extensive quotation from Latin poets and
prose writers from Plautus downwards. The fact that few quo-
tations are from writers later than the Augustan period seems to
show that his sources were, in the main, the grammatical and
lexicographical writers of the 1st century of the Empire—e. g.
Verrius Flaccus, and dictionaries and grammars based upon him
—not, as is sometimes asserted, Aulus Gellius or later writers.

Among readings or emendations due to or supported by him in
Virgil are ‘populos’ for ‘Rutulos' Aen. x· 111 (accepted by

abridgements will be found in two lectures by Professor Nettleship, printed
in the ‘ American Journal of Philology‚’ Vol. i. No. 3, and Vol. ii. No. Ι.
