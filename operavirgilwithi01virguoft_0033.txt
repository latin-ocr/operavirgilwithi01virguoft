II. THE TEXT OF VIRGJL. xxix

4. ‘ Roman' (Codex Romanus—R), in the Vatican Library,
contains Ecl., Georg, and Aen„ with 76 leaves out of 309 wanting ς
viz. Ecl. vii. 1—x. 9; G. ii. 2-215, iv. 37*180; Aen. ii. 73—iii. 684,
iv. 217—v. 36, xi. 757—792‚ xii. 759-830, 939-952. The character
(large capitals) resembles that found on the walls of Pompeii, and
inscriptions of the rst and 2nd centuries: but the barbarous errors of
the text ¹ and crudeness of the miniatures preclude its being of such
antiquity, and it is referred to the 4th or even the 5th century (Pal.
Soc., Pl. 113: Zang. and Watt.P1. 11). This MS„ which in the 13th
century belonged to the monastery of St. Denys in France‚ was
transferred to Rome, and there used byAngelo Poliziano (see below,
p. xliii), who notes its authority for the orthography ‘Vergilius'

The following are only fragmentary :

5. ‘St. Gall Palimpsest' (Schedae rescriptae Sangallenses—G.),
in the Benedictine library of St. Gall in Switzerland: 10 leaves
containing portions of G. iv, and Aen. i, iii, iv. Early in the 4th
century (Zang. and &Vatt 14 a).

6. ‘Verona Palimpsest' (Schedae rescriptae Verone7zses—V.), in
the Chapter Library at Verona, formerly at Bobbio: 51 leaves
from an old MS. akin to Med. and Pal, containing about 1320
lines : probably of the 4th or 5th century.

7. ‘Berlin Palimpsest ' (schedae Berolinenses or Puteanae—A.)‚
sometimes known as the ‘Augustean' fragment : 7 leaves, partly
at Rome, partly at Berlin, containing G. i. 41—280, iii. 181—220:
of the 4th century, probably near the end, though Ribbeck con-
siders it older than any extant MS. (Zang. and watt. 14). The
inscription CLAVDIVS · PVTEANVS · FVLVIO - VRSINO ·
D.D. shows that the MS. came from Gaul into Italy before 1594
when Puteanus died, and passed after Ursinus’ death in 1600 with
his other books to the Vatican library.

Of later (cursive) MSS. the following are quoted as of cor-
roborative value sor the text 2

8. Codex Gudianus (γ) at Berne, 9th century.

9. Codices Beruenses (a, b, and c), of the 9th and Ioth centuries.

10. ,Codex Mz'noraztgzensz's (m), perhaps of 12th century.

11. Codex· Bodlez’anus (ο), 11th century.

It is seldom, however, that any cursive MS. gives a reading which
is not suggested either by an uncial MS. or by the early commen-
tators, and they are therefore of but slight independent value²;

² Some idea of the quantity and quality of existing cursive MSS. of
Virgil may be formed from the fact that the Bodleian Library alone pos-
