I. LIFE ΛΝΒ POEMS OF VIRGIL. xvii

it has been remarked that some of the descriptions of scenery in
the Eclogues, which are unsuitable to Mantua, and are generally
regarded as Sicilian, would suit the country about Tarentum. All,
however, that can be inferred is that Virgil may have spent some
time there during this period.

5. In a quarrel with some soldier or soldiers, arising out of his

, ejection from his farm, Virgil had been assisted by C. Cilnius

Maecenas, the famous patron and friend of his after years, in
compliment to whom, and under whose encouragement‚ he under-
took the ‘Georgics:⁷ his attention being now turned to the
didactic poetry of Hesiod, Nicander, and Aratus, as it had hitherto
been to the pastoral⁷⁷⁷poetry of Theocritus. The Georgics, we
know, were read by Virgil and Maecenas to Augustus on his
return from the East in 29⁶,BJQ Suetonius tells us that the poet
was engaged upon them sor seven years, which would give 36 Β. C.
for their commencement; a date intrinsically probable from the
completion of the Eclogues in 37 B.C., and incidentally confirmed
by the allusion in G. ii. 161 to the Julian harbour constructed in
37—the earliest reference in the Georgics to any contemporary
event.

They cannot, however, have been written continuously as we
now read theml. The end, for example, of G. i. (498—514), with
its tone of doubt and apprehension, must have been written in
33-32 Β. C. (see notes) ; while its opening lines, and those of G. iii,
breathing a spirit of triumphant exultation at assured success and
order restored, cannot well have been written before 30—29 B.C.—
possibly for the recitation in 29. The end of G. ii, again, seems
to belong to the same period as the end of G. i. (see notes to
ii. 496, 497, 504); while ii. 171-172 must allude to 31 B.C. From
Virgil’s own statement in iv. 563 it appears that much of the
Georgics was written at Naples: and it is possible that before
writing iii. 10 sqq. he had actually visited Greece. Such a visit
would agree with Hor. Od. i. 3, alluding to the visit to Attica of
one Vergilius, a dear friend3 an ode which cannot well refer to
Virgil’s only recorded visit to Greece at the end of his life (see
Wickham, ad loa).

6. The remaining ten years of Virgil’s life (29—19 B.C.) were
devoted to the ‘Aeneid,' the most enduring monument not only of
his own fame, but of the fortunes of Rome3 the epic, as it has
