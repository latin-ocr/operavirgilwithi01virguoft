4. MACROBIUS (end of 4th cent), author of a commentary on
Cicer0⁷s ⁴ Somnium Scipionis‚' wrote seven books of ‘Saturnalia' in
the form of dialogues on various subjects of literature and Roman
religious antiquities. The chief part of the work is a discussion on
Virgil‚ who is attacked by one Evangelus‚ and defended as aphilo-
sopher by Eustathius‚ as an expert on ‘ius augurale’ and ‘ius
pontificum’ by Flavianus and Praetextatus, as an antiquary by
Albinus, and on other grounds by Servius (see above B, 18) and
Avienus. The chief heads of criticism may be thus summed up :
Ι. Virgil's use oflanguage ; 2. his management of his story 3 3. his
relation to Homer and earlier Greek poets, and 4. to less known
Greek poets; 5. his knowledge of antiquities. As above stated,
Macrobius has plagiarised freely, and without acknowledgement‚
from Gellius and others, and probably also from Servius.

D. History of the Text.

It is difficult to mark special periods or stages in the history of
a text upon which copyists and commentators were so continually
at work as on that of Virgil. But in the history of Latin textual
criticism generally there are three clearly marked epochs of cor-
rection and recension by which the text of all the chief Latin
authors was more or less affected: viz. (Ι) the 5th century A.D. ;
(2) the Carolingian revival of the Sth and 9th centuries3 (3) the
period of the Renaissance.

(1) In the 5th century a reaction against Christianity among the
upper classes of Roman society revived the study of the pagan
classics ε and many ‘ subscriptiones,' or footnotes‚ to existing MSS·
attest their recension by scholars and students‚ often men of good
birth and position. The MS. which contains such a ‘subscriptio'
is, of course, seldom of the same date as the ‘subscriptor;’ but
the latter can not unfrequently be otherwise identified. One

¹ In the second of the two papers on Verrius Flaccus, referred to above,
Professor Nettleship shows that the numerous coincidences between .A·
Gellius and Nonius, from which it has usually been inferred that Nonius
copied Gellius, are due to their having independently used the same au-
thorities, particularly Verrius.
