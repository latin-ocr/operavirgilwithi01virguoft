himself. Finally, he left all his writings to Varius and Tucca, on
the understanding that they should publish nothing which he had
not already published. Fortunately for literature, they saw that
the truest friendship would be shown in disregarding such requests:
and acting under the authority of Augustus, they edited the Aeneid,
with only such corrections as were absolutely necessary, leaving
unfinished lines and inconsistencies of detail exactly as they found
thern. In what they did, and in what they left undone, they were
faithful to their friend’s memory. Augustus, too, had sufficient
insight to discern the real merits of the work, and its probable
value as a testimony to his own renown: and there is nothing
improbable in the tradition that Varius and Tucca acted, if not
under the instructions, at least with the knowledge and sanction of
the Emperor.

8. The poetica] reputation accorded to Virgil was immediate
and lasting. ‘An undisputed place (writes Dr. Kennedy¹) at the
head of Roman literature was given to the avowed rival of Homer
and Hesiod, the master of the grandest Latin versification, the
glorifier of Rome and of Augustus . . . In all literary circles of
Rome Virgil was extolled and quoted ; in schools he was taught ε
his writings and the events of his life supplied material for lectures,
essays, comments, to a long series of grammarians, and to col-
lectors of literary gossip such as Aulus Gellius and Macrobius.'
His work did not, indeed, escape criticism on points of detail.
He was attacked for innovations in language, such as Horace
stamps with approval in a passage (A. P. 45 sqq.) written while
the Aeneid was in progress ; for defects in arrangement and hand-
ling of his materials; for his close imitation of Homer3 and for
ignorance of religious antiquities. But from poets—who are per-
haps the best judges of poetry—he won immediate and unanimous
appreciation. Propertius, as has been mentioned, saw in the Aeneid
⁴ something greater than the Iliad,' and its immediate effect may
be seen in the frequent allusions to the story of Aeneas in the 4th
book of Horace’s Odes, written within five or six years after Virgil's
death. Ovid (Am. i. 15. 25) writes of him :

‘Tityrus et fruges Aeneiaque arma legentur,
Roma triumphati dum eaput orbis erit:'

and subsequent Roman poets, with the exception perhaps of
Lucan (whose rivalry only brings out the greatness of Virgil), paid
him the ‘sincerest fiattery' of undisguised imitation. Juvenal has
