xxviii INTRODUCTION.

authors are represented by even one MS. of so early a date, while
for some of the most important (e. g. Horace, Lucretius, Caesar)
we have no MS. evidence earlier than the 8th or 9th century : but
of Virgil there are no less than four more or less complete MSS„
and three sets of fragments, which can be assigned to the 4th and
5th century ΑΛ). A description of these MSS, with a critical
estimate of their relative peculiarities and value, is given in
Ribbeck's Prolegomena‚ Chs. xi-xiii, pp. 218—3203 facsirniles
of the handwriting employed being appended to the Index.
Photographic facsirniles of single leaves may be found in the
collection published by the Palaeographical Society‚ and that of
Zangemeister and Wattenbach‚ published at Heidelberg.

The four great MSS„ to which reference is chiefly made, are——

1. ‘Vatican' (Schedae Vatz'canae, usually cited as F.)‚ in the
Vatican Library at Rome: containing portions of G. iii, iv, and
Aen. i—viii. Written probably in the 4th century, though some
have considered the miniatures which adorn it to be even older
(Palaeogr. Soc. Pl. 1163 Zang. and Watt. Pl. 13). It belonged
successively to Fontanus, Cardinal Bembo, and Fulvius Ursinus
(Orsini) ; the latter of whom gave it to the Vatican Library before
his death in 1600.

2. ‘ Medicean’ (Codex Medicam—M), in the Laurentian Library
at Florence : contains Ecl. from vi. 48, Georg.‚ and Aen. A note
at the end of Ecl. states that it was read and corrected by one
Asterius, ‘consul ordinarius :⁷ and as Asterius was consul 494 A.D.,
it must be prior to that date—probably of the 5th century. [Rib-
beck considers that this note or ‘subscriptio' was copied on to
this MS. from some other in the 6th or 7th century.] (Pal. Soc.
Pl. 86 : Zang. and Watt. Pl. 10.) It once belonged to the Vatican
Library, but was purchased by Cosmo de Medici from the heirs
of Cardinal Rodolpho Pio, who died in 1564. First collated by
Nic. Heinsius in 1676 ; printed at Florence in 1741.

3. ‘Palatine' (Codex Palatinus—R), in the Vatican Library,
brought thither from the Palatine Library at Heidelberg on its
capture by the Bavarians in 1622. Contains Ecl., Georg.‚ and
Aen.: 33 leaves (out of 280) are wanting—viZ. E. iii. 71—iv. 52 ; G.
i. 323—ii. 139, iv. 461—Aen. i. 277 ; Aen. iv. 116-162, vii. 277-645,
x. 463-509, xi. 646-692‚ 7 37-783‚ xii. 47-93. Probably of the 4th
cent. (3rd or 4th Edd. Pal. Soc.; 4th or 5th Ribbeck—Pal.
Soc. Pl. 115, Zang. and Watt. Pl. 12). It was the basis of editions
(Commelin) published at Heidelberg in 1589, 1599—1603: but the
first accurate collation is that made by Ribbeck.
