III. ORTHOGRAPHV. liii

G. ii. 179 ‘collesz’ why ‘collis' 113 (Ribb. ‘colles,⁷ citing no
MS. for ‘-is ²) and 276 (‘colles’ Pal„ Rom.‚ Ver.‚ Gud., b, c)?

Ecl. Χ. 16 ‘oves2' why ‘ovis’ 18 and 68 (‘oves' Pal„ Rom.‚
Gud. 1)? Ecl. iii. 94 ‘oves’ (vocat.): why ‘ovis’ 3, 5 and 98
(Ribb. ‘oves,’ citing only b for ‘-is')?

G. i. 65 ‘fortes:’ why ‘iacentis' in same line (‘iacentes’ Med,
Rom.‚ b)?

Ecl. ix, 4 ‘veteres : ² why ‘veteris' 9 (Ribb. ‘veteres' in spite of
Pal„ Gud., a, b) ?

G. i. 161 ‘messes:' why ‘messis' 103 (Ribb. ‘messes,⁷ citing
no vv. ll.)?

415. In the above examples (few out of hundreds) we 500 that
our existing MSS. credit Virgil with fluctuations of orthography
scarcely conceivable in so carefully polished a writer, and some-
times involving grammatical ambiguity. We also 500 that MSS.
do not always agree, especially in a preference for the form in
‘ -is ⁷: and we further see that scholars do not always agree on the
inference to be drawn from MS. evidence. It may also be noted
that while Ribbeck (Prol. pp. 405, sqq.) enumerates seventy-six
instances (of adjectives or substantives) where the best MSS.
agree in the form ‘—is‚' he gives 94 where the agreement is for
‘—es :² the evidence being in a far larger number of cases divided.

It should be added that the evidence from inscriptions of Re-
publican times does not bear out the view that ‘-is’ was a more
ancient or more universal form of this termination. The following
results are arrived at by the late Prof. Ramsay (Introd. to Plaut.
‘Mostellaria '): ‘-eis‚’ ‘—is‚' and ‘-es' are all found on old inscrip-
tions: but of these ‘-es' occurs earliest—e. g. OPSIDES on the
epitaph of Scipio Barbatus B.C. 250 (Mommsen, C. I. 29, 303 Roby,
Lat. Gr. 1, app. B, viii.) 3 VIRTVTES, Epit. of L. Corn. Scipio, cons.
B.C. 176 (Momms. 34, Roby xiii) ; Hommzs, MVLIERES, ‘ S. C. De
Bacchanalibus,' B.C. 186 (Momms. 196, Roby x) ; RECVPERATORES,
⁶ Tabula Bantina,' B.C. 130—120 (Momms. 197, Wordsw. ‘Fragm.⁷p.
173) :—‘ -is' does not appear on inscriptions previous 10 1110 Tabula
Bantina3 while on nine inscriptions of various length (Momms.
198-206) from the ‘Lex Repetundarum' (Wordsw. p. 176) of 123
B.C. to the ‘Lex Julia Municipalis' of 45 B.C. (Roby xxvi, XVordSW.
p. 213), ί-157 15 only found eight times, and ‘—es’ much more
frequently. On one short inscription of 132 B. C. found at Polla
in Lucania (Momms. 551, Roby xvii), ‘-eis‚’ ‘—is‚' and ‘-es’ are
all found, viz. ΡΟΝΤΕ15 OMNEIS, AEDIS POPL1CAS, and HOMINES.
