ideas of the time: an examination of which (such as Prof. Sellar
gives 1) shows that the reverence for Augustus which finds expres-
sion in Virgil and Horace was a genuine popular sentiment, the
outcome of a variety of feelings—-a mixture of the old Greek hero-
worship, of Eastern monarchical sentiment, and of the revived
national enthusiasm for the ‘Imperium Romanum,' and the
destiny of the Eternal City, ‘the conception which, throughout
the long roll of human history, has come nearest to the unchange-
able and the divine2.’ These feelings centred in Augustus as the
restorer of peace and order after civil war and bloodshed³‚ as the
upholder of the old Roman customs and religion4 against the
threatened inroad with Antony and his ‘Aegyptia coniunx’ of
Eastern barbarism, and as the visible impersonation os ‘Fortuna
Urbis,’ the deity who watched over the fortunes of Rome. From
this point of view the opening lines of G. i. and iii. and similar
passages, however repugnant to modern taste, are neither un—
natural nor derogatory to Virgil's poetic fame. Right or wrong,
thgy express the thoughts not of a courtier, but of a nation3 and
the poet by whom those thoughts are ‘married to immortal verse,'
deserves, if ever poet did, the name of ‘national.'

ΙΙ. ΤΗΕ TEXT OF VIRGIL.

A. Manuseripts.

The wide-spread popularity of Virgil’s poems during the times
of the Roman Empire, and afterwards in the Middle Ages,
led to a more rapid multiplication and more careful preservation
of MS. copies than in the case of any other ancient writings with
the exception of the New Testament: and the evidence for his
text is conspicuous not only for quantity, but for quality. It may
be assumed as a general principle that the earlier the date of
MSS„ the better their authority 3 not that older MSS. necessarily
represent a better text, but because the risk of corruption and
variation increases with each successive generation of copyists.
With the exception of one or two fragments, such as those ofa
papyrus from Herculaneum (which must be prior to 79 A.D.), the
‘uncial' or ‘capital' MSS. of the 4th and 5th centuries are the
oldest extant specimens of writing. Comparatively few Latin
