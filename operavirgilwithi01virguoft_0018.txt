and the population, however assimilated to the Italian races, must
have retained a large admixture of Celtic blood. ‘Andes' is
probably a Celtic name, sor Caesar (B. G. ii. 35) mentions a Gallie
tribe and town of that name, now ‘Angors' in the Anjou district ;
and so, according to one theory, is ‘Vergilius ’——though Corssen¹
more probably connects it with ‘ Vergiliae,⁷ a name for the Pleiades
as rising at the end of spring (vergo), comparing it with ‘Quin—
tilius,’ ‘Sextilius,' ‘Marcius,' and other names originally denoting
time of birth.

2. His parents were of obscure social position; but, like those
of Horace, were able to appreciate their son's taient, and give him
the best education obtainable. At twelve years old he was sent
to Cremona, the birthplace of the poet Furius Bibaculus, thirty
years his senior, and of Quintilius Varus (Hor. Od. i. 24, A. P.
438), the critic and friend of both Horace and Virgil. At sixteen
he assumed the ‘toga virilis' and went to Milan, removing thence
to Rome in 53 B.C., when in his seventeenth year 3 and, after the
fashion of the time, studied, first rhetoric under Epidius (also the
teacher of the young Octavianus), and then philosophy under
Siron, a celebrated exponent of Epicureanism. To the period
spent at Rome are assigned some of the collection of short poems
called‘ Catalepton2’ (ποιήματα κατὰ λεπτόν, or ‘minor poems ⁷), which
bear his name, but which can hardly all have been by his hand.
Three of them (iii, iv, and v) are abusive lampoons in the style of
Catullus and Horace, which no one would willingly believe to be
written by Virgil. The parody on Catullus’ ‘Phaselus ille' (No.
viii) may well be his : so may vi, in which a sacrifice is promised
to Venus in the event of finishing the Aeneid, and x, which seems
to refer to his ejection from his farm in 41 B. C. (Ecl. i, ix, see
below, ξ 4). More interesting is vii, written apparently when be-
ginning philosophical studies, and expressing delight at ex-
changing rhetorical and grammatical studies for philosophy :

‘Ite hinc, inanes rhetorum ampullae,
Inflata rore non Achaico verba,

¹ ‘Aussprache,' etc„ i. pp. 543, 544 (znd ed). The word ‘virga,' which
has been connected with ⁶ Vergilius‚' is referred by Corssen (ii. p. 521) and
Curtius (Greek Etymology, ξ 184) to a root ‘ varg;’ Skt. ‘firg,' ‘ st1·ength,’
‘urng⁷ ‘sap3' Gk. ὀργώω, ‘to swell,' ὀργή, ‘impulse3’ Lat. ‘virgo' (so
ὀργάδες, of the full shape of marriageable maidens).

‘ Catalect0n‚’ and an instructive criticism upon the claims of the poems to
genuineness, see Professor Nettleship's ‘ Aneient Lives of Vergil.’
