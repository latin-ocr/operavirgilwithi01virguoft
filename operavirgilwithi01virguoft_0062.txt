lviii INTROD UCTION.

or slight break in the sentence : and it is used by him as a purely
antiquarian ornament. With Ennius, on the contrary, whom Virgil
seems to follow in this licence, the apparent violation of quantity
as fixed in Augustan prosody is no ‘licence‚² because the syllables
in question were originally long, and were subsequently shortened
by a familiar tendency of the Latin language, due mainly to the fact
that final syllables were never accented.

(a) Nouns, etc. in ‘—or;' ‘Amor et' Ecl. x, 69‚‘1abc·›r: aeque'
G. iii. 118, ‘melior insignis ' G. iv. 92. The corresponding Greek
-ωρ, and the prosody of oblique cases (‘am6ris‚' eto), point to the
original length of this syllable, which is always so in Ennius, even
in thesi, i. e. the unemphatic syllable of a foot, e. g.

‘Clamor ad caelum volvendus per aethera vagit' (Ann. 520).

The same applies to ‘pater’ (πατὴρ) Aen. v. 521 ; but ‘puer’ (Ecl.
ix. 66), ‘super' (Aen. vi. 254), ‘ebflr' (Aen. xii. 68), show that
Virgil uses the licence as mere matter of form, with no thought
of etymology.

(b) Verb terminations in ‘r :² ‘-or’ of first pres. pass. is naturally
long, and is so used by Ennius and Plautus. Virgil does not
follow them in this; but has in 3 sing. ‘ingreditur' (G. iii. 76),
‘datur' (Aen. v. 284), and in 1 plur. ‘obruimur' (Aen. ii. 211),
neither of which has any precedent in Ennius.

(c) Noun terminations in ‘-s;' ‘sanguis' always in Lucretius,
once only in Virgil (Aen. x. 487): ‘-fis ³ from ‘o-' stems (G. iii. 189,
Aen. v. 337, etc.) is found also in Ennius, perhaps from imitation
Of Homeric use in e. g. Iliad i. 244 χωόμενος, ὅτ’ ι’ίριστον Ἀχαιῶν
οὐδὲν ἕτισαςε ‘-bfis' dat. plur. (Aen. iv. 64) has no example in
Ennius and few in Plautus.

(d) Verb terminations in ‘-s :² only ‘fatigamus’ (Aen. ix. 610),
0 which finds no analogy in Ennius or in the corresponding Greek
*μες, -μεν,

(e) Verb-endings in ‘-t’ (3 sing.); ‘at' of pres. ind. Ist conj.
generally in Ennius and often in Plautus, never in Virgil; ‘-at’
of imperf. in Plautus and Ennius even in thesi (‘ Noenum
rumores ponebat ante salutem' 314); in Virgil only in arsi
(Ecl. i. 39, Aen. v. 853, xii. 722, etc.): ’ἐπ’ pres. indic. Aen. i.
