xxxvi IN TROD UCTION.

Flagrius ⁷), author of a commentary on Ecl. and Georg„ which is
of some value and drawn from good sources—Celsus, Verrius
Flaccus, etc. His date is uncertain, but may be contemporary
with Servius z neither mentions the other.

18. SERVIUS (as he is called in all MSS. prior to 15th cent.—
later MSS. add ‘Honoratus Maurus'), author of a commentary on
Virgil which probably embodies many results of earlier Virgilian
learning, and is of considerable value. Acron, the Scholiast on
Horace, calls him ‘magister urbis' (?head of the teachers). In
the ‘Saturnalia' of Macrobius, written about 400 A.D. but pro—
fessing to give dialogues that took place before 385, Servius is an
interlocutor, who answers hostile criticisms (Macr. i. 2. 15, vi. 6.
1, etc.); but his remarks stand in no real relation to the Com-
mentary, being put into his mouth from many sources. The
Commentary as we have it indicates a wide range of reading,
especially in mythology,history, and religious antiquitie53 its author
being apparently a Pagan, and marking the reaction against
Christianity which prevailed among literary men of the time. It
is no doubt constructed out of very ancient materials, and pre-
serves for us, it may be at second hand, learning drawn from
Varro, Hyginus, Verrius Flaccus, etc.: and it ranks with the
Verona Scholia and Philargyrius in this respect. Additions seem
to have been made to the original homogeneous work (or ‘Vul-
gate') of Servius in the 9th or loth centuries, consisting perhaps
of remarks from other old commentators copied into the body of
Servius’ own work. The MSS. containing these additions were
published by Peter Daniel in 1600, and the commentary thus
enlarged is known as ‘Daniel’s Servius)

19. TITIANUS and CALVUS, mentioned by Servius on Aen. Χ. 18,
are samples of the rhetorical point of view of Virgilian criticism‚
which prevailed when Virgil became the staple of education ; the
speeches and sayings of Virgilian characters being analysed ac-
cording to the rules of artificial rhetoric. See Macrob. iii. 19. 6.

20. The BERNE SCHOLIA (on Ecl. and Georg.) profess to be
excerpts from commentaries by T. Gallus Gaudentius and Junilius
Flagrius, compiled by a Scot (Adananus) in the Sth century.
Junilius Flagrius has been identified above (No. 17): Gaudentius
and Gallus seem to have compiled their criticisms from Servius,
using respectively the shorter and longer form ; and have there-
fore no independent value.
