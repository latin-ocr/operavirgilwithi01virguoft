poetry and on grammar, and is cited as a commentator on V irgil
by Ver. Schol. In Aen. iii. 484 he read ‘honoress

12. CAESELLIUS VINDEX, author of ‘ Lectiones Antiquae,' cited
by Gellius ii. 16, and probably laid under contribution‚ ib. ix. 14.
He testified to ‘dies ' (gen. sing.) in G. i. 208, ‘dii ' Aen. i. 636 ;
and explained ‘postuma proles' Aen. vi. 763 as ‘postremo loco
natus.'

13. SULPICIUS APOLLINARIS, of Carthage, wrote ‘Quaestiones
Epistolicae‚' and metrical ‘arguments ' to the plays of Plautus and
Terence and the books of the Aeneid. Gell. ii. 16. 8, etc. speaks
of him as a learned and elegant scholar.

14. IULIUS HATERIANUS (3rd cent.ad fin.), mentioned in Macrob.
iii. 8. 2 and Ver. Schol. (on Aen. vii. 337, etc.) as a commentator
on Virgil. In x. 242 he read ‘igni ' for ‘ ipse!

15. The VERONA SCHOLIA, written on the margin of the Verona
Palimpsest (V.), quote many scholars by name, their original
composition being probably older than Servius and Philargyrffls,
who as a mle say little of their authorities ; but not earlier than the
latter part of the 3rd century, as they mention Haterianus. They
are valuable even in a fragmentary state3 and would probably
throw much light on Virgilian criticism‚ did we possess them
entire.

16. AELIUS DONATUS, (4th cent„ middle), the teacher of St.
Jerome, spoken of as ‘orator urbis Romae! His commentary on
Terence is justly celebrated ; and his ‘Ars Grammatica' (‘ Donati
regulae ²) was throughout the Middle Ages the regular handbook
of grammatical teaching. It seems to have been of a very trivial
character, and the specimens of Virgilian criticism that are cited
as his are but little better ; e. g. Aen. ii. 798 ‘exilio'=‘ex Ilio,' ib.
537 ‘ lItus' conn. with ‘ lstaress xii. 585 ‘trahunt in moenia’= ‘ dila-
cerant in moenibus.' His view of Ecl. iii. 102 shows better
acquaintance with Terentian than with Virgilian idiom. The life
of Virgil prefixed to his commentary, and commonly attributed to
him, is probably by Suetonius3 as that of Terence, prefixed to
this Terentian commentary, admittedly is. Prof. Nettleship has
discussed this point in his ‘Essay on the Poetry of Virgi1,² pp.
28-31.·

The same life is prefixed to a commentary on the Aeneid by
Tib. Claudius Donatus (end of 4th cent.), written for his son's
education, and consisting mainly of paraphrases, etc. to show the
connection of ideas.
