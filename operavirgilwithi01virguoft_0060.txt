ing with it—‘ volvere Ι Parcas ;' (2) caesura between the short
syllables of the dactyl—‘ saevique Ι dolores? All other closing
rhythms are with him exceptional‚ sometimes in imitation of
Greek rhythm (eg. hymenffios, cyparissis, Laodamia), sometimes
for special effect (e. g. ‘quadrupedantum' Aen. xi. 614, ‘pudeat
sola neve' G. i. 80, ‘procumbit humi bos ;' or spondaic endings,
as ‘ abscondantur⁷ G. i. 226, ‘purpureo narcisso’ Ecl. v. 38).

3. A purely dactylic line, common enough in Greek (e. g. Iliad
i. 13, 25, 31, 32, 34, 54, and so on in like proportion), is compara-
tively rare in Virgil’s epic poetry3 such a line as ⁴ Quadrupedante
putrem sonitu quatit ungula campum' (Aen. viii. 596, cp. G. iii.
201) being a conscious imitation of the sound of galloping, and
its jerky movement being foreign to the stately march of epic
rhythm. The greater length of many Greek words, with a greater
abundance of long compmmds, prevented the Homeric hexameter
from moving too rapidly or jerkily—e. g. Iliad i. 87 Εὐχόμενος Δα-
ναοῖσι θεοπροπίας ἀναφαίνεις-ἰ but in Virgil the rapid movement is
almost always checked and the rhythm, as it were, collected and
steadied by a spondaic fourth foot—e. g. Aen. i. 45 ‘ Turbine corri—
puit scopuloque infixit acuto] The spondaic fourth foot is indeed
specially characteristic of Virgil's epic rhythm, as the dactylic
fourth foot ending a word (‘Bucolic caesura ’) is of his Eclogues
in imitation of Theocritus : and wherever, for the sake of variety,
the fourth foot is dactylic‚ one or more of the preceding feet is
spondaic to restore the balance. The student can verify this for
himself on any page of the Aeneid.

It thus seems that Virgil, in adapting the Homeric hexameter
to the Latin language, realised that its dactylic rhythm must be
modified by a large admixture of ‘spondei stabiles‚' as Horace
calls them (A. P. 256). A considerable majority of his verses
have at least three spondees (including the last foot); and the
proportion of fifteen such lines in Aen. i. 1-20 to nine in Iliad i.
1—20 may be taken as a rough measure of the extent to which he
carried out this modification of Homeric rhythm. A spondee in
the first foot‚ contained in a single word and followed by a pause
in sense, is almost the only circumstance under which he seems
to shrink from spondaic rhythm in the first four feet: and the
somewhat slow and ponderous movement thus given to the verse
at starting is reserved, as a rule, for the special expression of
solemnity or emotion (see note to Ecl. v. 21).

4. The hexameters of Ennius are a first experiment to reproduce,
in a rough unpolished material, the rhythm of Homer. The con-
