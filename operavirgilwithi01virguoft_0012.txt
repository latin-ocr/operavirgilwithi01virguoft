freely of this method. To leave my own judgment as unbiassed
as possible, I have avoided consulting any continuous prose
translation, such as those of Professor Conington, and Messrs.
Lonsdale and Lee. Ι have, however, kept before me Dr.
Kennedy’s translation of the Eclogues into blank verse; Mr.
R. D. Blackmore’s of the Georgics into ten-syllable couplets
(less known than it deserves to be, though not always reliable
on points of scholarship); and Professor Conington's of the
Aeneid into the metre of Sir W. Scott’s longer poemS. Occa-
sionally Ι have quoted direct from these versions ; and Ι have
been indebted to them for many turns of expression.

The literary criticism of Virgil's poems has been so abund-
antly and ably handled in Professor Conington’s Introductions‚
Professor Sellar’s volume ‘ On the Roman Poets of the Augustan
Age‚' and Professor Nettleship’s ‘ Suggestions Introductory to a
Study of the Aeneid,’ that it seemed unnecessary to devote
much space to what could after all be only a re'clzauffe' of these
works. I have preferred to dwell at rnore length upon matters
which, so far as I know, are not much treated of in existing
editions—viz. questions of textual criticism and orthography.
As discussion of the relative merit of various readings must
enter into any commentary‚ the student should have easy access
to some knowledge of the amount and kind of evidence avail-
able for determining the text; and as orthography is a subject
upon which scholars do not all agree, an editor should at least
offer some justification of that which he himself adopts. To
one case of disputed orthography Ι may call attention here. It
is now the fashion to affect greater accuraey by writing the
poet’s name as ‘VergiL’ ‘Vergilius’ is probably correct; but
in retaining as the Anglicised form of that name the familiar
⁴ virgil: Ι am content to err (if error it be) in the company of
such scholars as Mr. Munro, Professor Sellar, and Dr. Kennedy.
