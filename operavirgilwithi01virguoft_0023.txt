I. LIFE ΛΝΒ POEMS OF VIRGIL. Xix

ance. Three or four years after Augustus' letter, Virgil consented
to read three books (iv, vi, and another) to the Emperor ; the date
being approximately fixed by the death of young Marcellus ΒΕ. 23,
to whose memory the famous passage vi. 860-886 was inserted.
According to Suetonius, Virgil first drafted the story in prose, and
then wrote different parts in no certain order, as the fancy took
him ; the division into twelve books being part of his original plan.
Internal evidence bears out this statement; thus, eg. Book ix.
must have been finished before v, Nisus and Euryalus being there
introduced as though for the first time, while in v. they take a
leading part in the games. Book iii, again, was probably written
before ii, at the end of which (776 sqq.) Creusa appears to Aeneas
after her death with a prophecy which is wholly unnoticed in
Book iii. Books iv. and vi, as we have seen, were in a finished
state in the year 23 B.C. If to all this we add the fact that Virgil
never carried out his intended correction and revision of the epic
as a whole, the wonder is, not that inconsistencies are found in it,
but that the story is, on the whole, as harmoniously and consistently
worked out as, in the Introductions to the notes on each book,
Ι have tried to show,

7. In the year 19 B.C. Virgil, then in his 52nd year, set out to
travel in Greece and Ᾰέἰει, intending to devote three years to the
completion and correction of the Aeneid. At Athens he met
Augustus returning from the East‚ and decided to go back to
Rome with the Emperor : but being seized with illness on a visit
to Megara under a burning sun, and continuing his voyage in spite
of the attack, he died at Brundisium on Sept. 21, a few days after
landing. His ashes were taken to Naples and buried in a tornb
on the road to Puteoli. On the tomb was inscribed a couplet <said
to have been written by himself), into which is condensed almost
all that is known of the uneventful life (‘ studiis florentem ignobilis
oti’ G. iv. 564) of the scholar and poet ε

‘Mantua me genuit; Calabri rapuere3 tenet nunc
Parthenope; cecini pascua, rura, duces?

He is said to have acquired, from imperial and other benefactors‚
a considerable fortune (=A{90,000)‚ of which he left half to his
half-brother, a quarter to Augustus, a twelfth to Maecenas, and the
rest to his friends and literary executors, Varius and Tucca.
Before leaving Italy he had directed Varius to burn the MS. of
the Aeneid in the event of his death3 and in his last hours he
is said to have repeatedly asked for it, that he might burn it
