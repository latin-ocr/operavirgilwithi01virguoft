Ι. LIFE AND POEMs OF V1RG1121.

Ι. Ρ. VERGILIUS MARO was born a. d. xvii Kal. Novembr.
(Oct. 15), in the year 70 B.C. [five years before Horace and seven
years before the Emperor Augustus] at Andes, a ‘pagus' or
country district in the neighbourhood of Mantua. The green
banks and slow windings of the Mincius, recalled with affectionate
memory in the Eclogues and Georgics, were thus familiar to him
from childh00d; but the only passage which seems to describe
the features of any one spot along that stream is Ecl. ix. 7—10 :

‘qua se subducere colles
Incipiunt, mollique iugum demittere clivo,
Usque ad aquam et veteres, iam fracta cacumina, fagos . . ‚⁹

‘The only hills in the neighbourhood‚' says Professor Sellar ², ‘to
which these lines can apply are those which for a time accompany
the flow of the river from the foot of the Lago di Guarda, and gradu-
ally sink into the plain a little beyond the picturesque hill and castle
of Valleggio‚ about fifteen miles higher up the river than Mantua.²
Pietola, three miles down the river from Mantua, was by a tradi-
tion as old as Dante’s time identified with Andes ; but lines 62-64
of the same Eclogue, implying that the two shepherds had further
than this to walk into Mantua, give an indirect support to Prof.
Sellar⁷s view. The ‘sacri fontes' of Ecl. i. 53 (cp. G. ii. 200> are
‘more naturally to be sought in the more picturesque en-
vironment of the upper reaches of the river than in the level
plain in the midst of which Mantua stands ²⁵ :⁷ and the accurate
description of the Lago di Guarda, in G. ii. 160, might well
reproduce familiar impressions of a scene not far from the
poet’s early home. Though Virgil claims a Tuscan origin for
Mantua (Aen. x. 203), Etruscan had long been superseded by
Gaulish (i.e. Celtic) settlements in the region north of the Ρο;
