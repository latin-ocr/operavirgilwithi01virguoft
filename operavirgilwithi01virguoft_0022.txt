been well called, of the Roman empire3 the sacred book of the
Roman religion, as summed up in the conception of ‘Fortuna
Urbis' with its visible embodiment in the Emperor¹3 the ex-
pression of all the varied beliefs of the time-national, religious,
historical, mythologica13 the ‘Gesta Populi Romani,' as some
called it on its first appearance. The idea of such a poem was
not altogether new to him (above ξ 3), but can hardly have
assumed definite shape in his mind before the year 29 B.C., in
which year probably he writes (G. iii. 46—48) that he intends to
celebrate Caesar’s exploits2. Once begun, the poem must have
proceeded steadily, if not rapidly (Quintilian, I. O. X. 3. 8 says, on
the authority of Varius, that Virgil wrote >very few lines in a day) 3
for in the year 26 B.C. we find Augustus, then absent on a cam-
paign in Spain, writing to ask for a sight of the first draft of the
Aeneid or any passage out of it. Virgil's reply3 is characteristic
of the modesty and losty standard of perfectiori which marked his
own appreciation of his work :

‘De Aenea quidem meo, si mehercule iam dignum auribus
haberem tuis, libenter mitterem; sed tanta inchoata res est ut
paene vitio mentis tantum opus ingressus mihi videar, cum prae—
sertim, ut scis, alia quoque studia ad id opus multoque potiora
impertiar?

F riends, however, of the poet began to spread reports that a
great work was coming to light; one of them being Propertius,
whose often quoted lines—

‘Cedite Romani scriptores, cedite Graii;
Nescio quid majus nascitur Iliade' (iii. 26. 65, 66)—

though dictated by friendly partiality, scarcely exaggerate the
estimate which was actually formed of the Aeneid upon its appear-

¹ ‘However variously expressed or shrouded, the religion of the Romans
was Rome,' F. W. H. Myers in the ‘ Fortnightly Review’ for February, 1879,
p. 185. This brilliant and suggestive article, instinct with the feeling of a
poet rather than of a critic, deserves to be enshrined in some less ephemeral
form than the pages of a magazine. Ι gratefully commend it to admirers
of Virgil's poetic genius.

² Professor Nettleship thinks that this cannot refer to the Aeneid, but to
some other projected work, of which the description of the battle of
Actium (Aen. viii. 67 5 sqq.) may have been intended to form part. That
description, however (see notes), is essentially in harmony with the scope of
the Aeneid, which may well, from one point of view, be regarded as a
poem in honour of Augustus.
