‘subscriptio' has already been referred to as helping to fix the
date of Cod. Med. It runs thus :—

TVRclvs RVFVS APRONIANVS AsTERlvs v-c. ET INL. Excomi—
TE DOMEST. PROTECT. Excoffi. PRsv. LARGff. EX PRAE‘E. VRBI
PATRlcivs ET CONSVL ORDI‘N. LEGI ET DISTINCXI CODICEM
FRATRIS MACHARII v‘c. NON MEI FIDUCIA SET Elvs cvi SI [?cvivs]
ET AD OMNIA SVM DEVOTvs ARBITRIO xl KAL. ΜΑἼ ROMAE1.

Then follow eight elegiae couplets‚ to the effect that Asterius
undertook this task at the time when he gave a great show to the
people‚ and earned great credit thereby. From the character of
the letters, which differs slightly from those of Cod. Med. itself,
Ribbeck (Prol. p. 223) concludes that the ‘ subscriptio' was copied
on to it in the 6th or 7th century from some other copy, perhaps
from that of Macharius: one thing at least being certain, that
Asterius punctuated and corrected (‘distincxi emendans' in the
first of his elegiac couplets) a MS. of Virgil in 494 A.D.‚ when he
was ‘consul ordinarius?

A few other ‘subscriptiones ' may be mentioned in illustration :

(a) To Horace ;--ι Vettius Agorius Basilius Mavortius vc. et
inl. Excom. Dom. excons. ord. legi et ut potui emendavi, conferente
mihi magistro Felice oratore urbis Romae! This Mavortius was
consul in 527 A.D.

(b) To Persius :—‘ Flavius Julius Trifonianus Sabinus tentavi
emendare sine antigrapho meum et adnotavi Barcelonae, coss.
Arcadio et Honorio '—i.e. 402 A. D.

(c) To Livy (1st decade) :—‘Victorianus emendabam dominis
Symmachis :’ ‘Nicomachus Dexter emendavi ad exemplum par-
entis mei.’ The Symmachi for three generations were prominent
adherents of Paganism in the 4th and 5th centuries (see Teuffel,
ξ 418). Nicomachus Dexter, 431 A. D.

(d) To Solinus (grammarian of the 3rd century), copied and
corrected ‘studio et diligentia Domni Theodosii invictissimi
principis :² i.e. Theodosius II, 402—450 A. D.

(e) To Vegetius (‘De re militari,' ete. end of 4th century) :—

¹ Asterius, patrician and ‘consul ordinarius’ (i. e. elected regularly, as
opposed to ‘suffectus ') had previously been (‘ex comite' :late ‘comes ')
offieer of the Imperial body-guard (‘ comes domesticus protectorius ⁵), Court

Almoner (‘comes privatae largitionis') and ‘praefectus urbi.’ ‘Comes'
implies in late Latin the holder of any state office; whence Fr. ‘ comte,⁷ our
‘count.' ‘vc. et inl.'=‘vir clarus et illustris,' a formal title of rank, like

our ‘right honourable,' ete.
