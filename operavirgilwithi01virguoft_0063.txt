TV. THE VIRGILIAN HEXAMETER. lix

sing.) ib. 702, ‘anima’ (nom. sing.) xii. 648; and thirteen in-
stances of ‘que’ (see on Aen. iii. 464), in imitation of Homeric
usage making τε long before double consonants‚ liquids‚ and sibi-
lants.

[Full lists of examples, from &Vagnen ‘Quaest. V irg.' xii, are
given in Professor N ettleship's ‘Excursus' to Aen. xii. (ed. Coning-
ton), and Dr. Kennedy’s Appendix, C, ΙΙ. (pp. 622—4, 2nd ed.)]

7. (ii.) Hiatus, i. e. non—elision of a vowel or diphthong before
another vowel or aspirate. This licence appears from a statement
of Cicero (Orator 45. 152 1) to have been common with the
older Latin poets‚ and occurs frequently in the dialogue of Plautus
and Terence ² : but it is used sparingly by later poets. The most
common conditions for its admission are (1) after long mono-
syllables, retaining their quantity in arsi, or shortened in thesi,
(e. g. the interjections ‘heu 1⁷ ‘o l’ ‘spe inimica ⁷ Aen. iv. 235, ‘te
Corydon ὅ Alexi’ Ecl. ii. 85, ‘an qui amant' viii. 108, ‘te amice’
Aen. vi. 507>: (2) at the regular caesuras 3 (3) wherever there is a
distinct pause in the sense (e. g. in dialogue, at the change of
speaker).

Of the fifty-three examples cited by &Vagner (Q. V. xi.) from
Virgi1‚forty show the unelided syllable in arsi⁷ and therefore
metrically emphatic. Of thirteen examples in thesi, eleven are
cases ofa long vowel shortened (Ecl. ii. 65, iii. 79, vi. 44, viii. 108 ;
G. i. 281, 332, 437, iv. 461 ; Aen. iii. 211, v. 261, vi. 507), which
thus seems the necessary condition for hiatus in thesi; the
remaining two (Ecl. iii. 53, Aen. i. 405) being justified by a dis-
tinct pause in the sense. Of the forty examples in arsi, twenty-
seven occur at one or other of the two important caesurae, the
penthemimeral and hephthemimeral (see above, footnote to ξ 2) :
ten of the remainder being at the ennehemimeral caesura (e. g.
‘Amphion Dircaeus in Actaeo l Aracyntho' Ecl. ii. 24), in obvious
imitation of the frequent Homeric cadence Πηληιάδεω Ἀχιλῆος (Il.

² Cicero is speaking of the tendency of Roman speech to run together
vowels, contrary to Greek practice, which allows hiatus: ‘Sed Graeci
viderint; nobis ne si cupiamus quidem distrahere voces conceditur. Indi—
cant . . . omnes poetae praeter eos qui ut versum facerent saepe hiabant. ut
Naevius “Vos qui accolitis Histrum flumen, atque algidam . . .'' ’ citing
also from Ennius and his own poenas,

² Ritschl and others, who, by alteration of text, restoration of obsolete
final consonants, etc. try to minimise hiatus in the comic writers, allow it
in about one out of twenty-two lines in Plautus and one out of sixty-six in
Terence. Wagner (Q. V. xi.) cites fifty-three examples from virgil.
