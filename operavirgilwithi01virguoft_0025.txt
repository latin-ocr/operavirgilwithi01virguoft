I. LIFE -AND POEMS OF VIRGJL. xxi

many references to familiar passages in the Aeneid : Martial,
among other tributes of admiration, says that V irgil might have
surpassed Horace in lyric and Varius in dramatic poetry (viii. 18.
5—9): and Pliny the Younger tells us (Ep. iii. 7) that among the
busts‚ statues», etc. possessed by the poet Silius Italicus were those
‘Vergilii ante omnes, cuius natalem religiosius quam suum cele-
bravit, Neapoli maxime, ubi monumentum eius adire ut templum
solebat! Passing on through the Middle Ages to modern times
we read of the fascination which Virgil’s poems had for theologians
such as Augustine and Bede, no less than for scholars like Scaliger,
for critics like Voltaire, for politicians like Burke, for poets, essay-
ists, orators, statesmen, without number. Two striking testimonies,
above all, have been paid by great genius to his influence. One is
the frequent imitation of his style in the language of Tacitus, the
one great literary genius of Imperial Rome, and one of the greatest
masters of expression in all literature. The other is the homage,
as of a disciple to his master, which Dante pays to the genius of
his countryman : ”

‘O degli altri poeti onore e lume,
Vagliami‚ 'l lungo studio e ’l grande amore,
Che m’ han fatto eercar lo tuo volume.
Tu se' lo mio maestro, e 'l mio autore:
Tu se' solo colui, da cu’ io tolsi ,
Lo bello stile, che m' ha fatto honore¹' (Inserno i. 85—87).

9. Two strange chapters in Virgil's posthumous renown are the
association of his name with Christian teaching and with magic
powers. The first arose from the supposed relation of Ecl. iv. (the
‘Messianic Eclogue') to prophecies of Christ, and obtained a
strong hold on the imagination of Christendom. ‘ In every age
of Christianity (says Mr. Myers²), from Augustine to Abelard, from
the Christmas sermon of Pope Innocent III. to the ‘⁶' Praelectiones
Academicae²⁷ of the late Mr. Keble, divines and fathers of the
Church have asserted the inspiration of this marvellous poem. It
was on the strength of this poem that Virgil's likeness was set

¹ ‘Glory and light of all the tnneful train!
May it avail me, that I long with zeal
Have sought thy volume, and with love immense
Have conn'd it o'er. My master thou, and guide!
Thou he, from whom alone Ι have derived
That style, which for its beauty into fame
Exalts me ' (Cary’s Translation).
