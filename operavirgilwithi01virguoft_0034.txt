XXX INTRODUCTION.

the chief interest of the most important of them (Gud. and
Bern. a) lying in their close relationship to Pal. and Rom. re-
spectively.

The comparative value of the leading MSS. (1—7) in cases of
doubtful reading is thus estimated by Ribbeck (Proleg. p. 320):
First he places Pal. (R), with Vat. (F.) and Verona fragm. (V.) of
nearly equal authority; Med. (M), though akin to P., is inferior
to it; while Rom. (R.) is least trustworthy of all. The St. Gall
and Berlin palimpsests (G. and A.) are too scanty to have much
value. The highest possible authority (p. 309) is the united
testimony of F. M. P. V. (Nos. 1, 2, 3, 6). As the result of his
investigations he assumes an ‘archetype,' or original copy, from
which all extant MSS. are derived, ‘currenti stilo parum nitide
scriptum, oppletumque nube conjecturarum, glossematum atque
interpolationum.' This conclusion that our existing uncial MSS.
represent a single ‘recension' of the text derives some support
from the fact that the early commentators occasionally supply
readings (some of them intrinsically probable) found in none of
the MSS.: the inference from which would be that they or their
authorities had access to another recension than that represented
by our MSS. Afew examples of such readings are—G. i. 508s0r-
mantur for conflantur (Nonius and Serv. on Aen. xii. 304) ; G. iii.
177 mulgaria for mulctraria (N onius and Philarg, citing Valgius
Rufus, an Augustan poet) ; ib. 415 gravi nidore (Non., Serv.);
Aen. ii. 62 dolo (Non. and Serv.) ; vii. 773 Phoebigenam sor MSS.
Poenzgenam (due to Probus alone); xii. 605 floras for flavos
(Serv.).

In spite, however, of such abundant MS. evidence—partly,
perhaps, from its very abundance—the text of Virgil, though not
in a bad state, is far from certain. The possibility that all our
MSS. represent but one recension detracts considerably from the

sesses forty-five such MSS, of which Mr. Madau, one of the Sub-Librarians
(who has examined them all), estimates three to rank with Codd. Ber-
uenses (a, b, c), nine as respectable, and the remainder worthless.

The complaint of Petrarch against professional copyists (stationarii)
shows the depth to which their art had sunk in the 14th century—‘ Quisquis
igitur pingere aliquid in membranis, manuque calamum versare didicerit,
scriptor habebitur, doctrinae omnis ignarus, expers ingenii, artis egens . . . .
nunc confusis exemplaribus et exemplis, unum scribere polliciti, sic aliud
scribunt ut quod ipse dictaveris non agnoscas . . . etc. . . . ‘De Remediis
