among the carven seers in the Cathedral of Zamora. It was on
the strength of this poem that in the Cathedrals of Limoges and
Rheims the Christmas appeal was made, “ O Maro, prophet os the
Gentiles, bear thou thy witness unto Christ’' . . . The poet Statius,
the martyr Secundianus, were said to have been made Christians
by its perusal. And the Emperor Constantine in his oration,
inscribed to the Assembly of Saints, and dedicated to the Church
of God, commented on this poem in a Greek version as forming a
link between the old and the new faiths¹.' In a mass sung in the
church of St. Paul at Mantua at the end of the 15th century was
the following stanza, lamenting Virgil's fate in not having lived to
be converted by St. Paul :

‘Ad Maronis mausoleum
Ductus fudit super eum
Piae rorem lacrimae;
“Quem te,'' inquit, “reddidissem
Si te vivum invenissem
Poetarum maxime !²” ’

This semi-Christian aspect of the poet in popular belief may also
have contributed to Dante's choice of him as guide through the
‘ Inferno' and ‘ Purgatorio.'

Popular traditions likewise represented Virgil as an enchanter or
magician: a notion which may have been originally suggested
partly by the account of the Sibyl and the world below in Aen. vi,
partly by Ecl. viii (pharmaceutria), partly perhaps by his mother’s
name Magia. Hence, perhaps, the peculiar mode of divination
known as the ‘Sortes Virgilianae '—i.e. opening the poems at
random to find some omen for the future—a striking instance of
which is noted on Aen. iv. 615. This strange invocation ‘has been
addressed to Homer, Virgil, and the Bible alonez⁷ and it is a
singular illustration of the spell exercised by Virgil’s name that
when Christianity substituted for the pagan mode of divination an
equally superstitious divination through the Bible or the Psalms,
the Roman poet should have kept his place side by side with the
Bible as an oracle of life.
