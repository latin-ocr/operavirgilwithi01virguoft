lx INTRODUCTION.

i. 1). Five of these latter, unlike the bulk of Homeric examples,
are spondaic endings (Ecl. viii. 53 ‘castaneae hirsutae,' Aen. iii.
74, vii. 631, ix. 647, xi. 31), due especially to the less dactylic char-
acter of the Latin language (see above, ξ 3); similar endings in
Homer being generally quadrasyllabic words (Ἀτρείδαο, Πηλειῶνα,
etc.) and never with trisyllable words embracing hiatus.

8. (iii.) Hypermetrie lines—i. e. with an additional syllable
aster the final trochee or spondee3 this syllable being always one
that may be elided, while the next line must begin with a vowel
or aspirate. This licence (resting apparently on a false assump-
tion that the scansion of hexameter verses is continuous, as in
Greek anapaests, and that the sixth foot is complete, i. e. a real
spondee) was unknown to Homer 3 οὐκ οἶδ’ at the close of a line of
Callimachus being the only known instance in Greek hexameters.
Lucretius employs it once (v. 849), Catullus rarely, in lyric metre
—e. g. lxi. 147 (Glyconic), and perhaps xi. 19 <Sapphic)—but there
‘omnffim' may be dissyllable by synizesis, as ‘precantia' Aen. vii.
237 (cp. ‘omnia' vi. 33). It is found in an iambic line of Pacuvius
preserved by Cicero, Tusc. iii. 12. 263 and occasionally in Terence
—e. g. Phorm. ii. 1. 63 ; Ad. ii. 2. 9, iii. 3. 21 (iambic) 3 And. iv. 1.
9 (cretic); Eun. iv. 1. 11 (trochaic>. Wagner on G. ii. 69 hardly
proves its use by Ennius: nor do Greek dramatists use it, as he
says, ‘infinitis locis! By whomever introduced into Latin hexa-
meters it is a purely artificial licence, and as such is used by
Virgil. In eighteen out of twenty-two instances in his poemS, the
hypermetric syllable is ‘que3' in G. i. 295 he has ‘decoquit
umorlem‚' and in Aen. vii. 160, ‘tecta Latinolrurn.' In all these
twenty examples the preceding syllable is long, making the last
foot a spondee: but in G. ii. 69, iii. 449, we have, if MSS. are to
be trusted, hypermetric syllables preceded by trochees (see note to
G. ii. 69).

9. Like all great masters of poetic rhythm, Virgil shows his
power in the accommodation of sound to sense. Familiar examples
of single lines are Aen. v. 481 (the sudden collapse of a stricken
ox), viii. 452 (the steady swing of the Cyclops' hammers), viii. 596
(the sound of galloping horses): but the poet's art is also shown
in passages of varied length, from the two lines expressive of the
⁶ moping owl's' complaint (Aen. iv. 462, 463), to the fine description
of a storm in G. i. 316-334 <see especially 328—334). Among innu-
merable examples the following are noticeable ε of single lines, G.
ii. 441 (gusts of wind assaulting a tree)‚ iii. 201 (the swift rush of
the wind as of a horse let loose); of longer passageS, G. i. 108-110
