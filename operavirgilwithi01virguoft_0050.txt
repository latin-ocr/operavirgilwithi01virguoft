It is unnecessary to do more than refer briefly to more recent
editions. That of Forbiger (1836—1839, 2nd edition 1845, 3rd 1852)
follows Wagner's text3 the notes being a useful compilation in
which previous editors have been laid under contribution, and
which has in its turn been laid under contribution by Professor
Conington (Ist ed. 1858—1871, 4th 1881) ; whose commentam, com—
pleted by Professor Nettleship, is now the standard authority on Vir-
gil in England, and is not likely to be easily superseded. More im-
portant than any of these (perhaps than any other previous edition
whatever) for the textual criticism of Virgil is that of Ribbeck, con·
taining as it does a more complete ‘apparatus criticus' than had
hitherto been accessible, with probably the first accurate collation
of one most important MS, the Codex Palatinus. Vol. i. (Bucolica
and Georgica) appeared in 18593 vol. ii. (Aen. I-VI) in 1860; vol.
iii. (Aen. VII—XII) in 1862; and vol. iv. (Prolegomena) in 1866.
The faults of this great edition (well criticised by Prof. Conington
in an essay now appended to his 3rd volume) arise mainly from
undue suspicion of the received text, and undue confidence in
critical sagacity to correct, transpose, and emend: but its solid
merits far outweigh defects and make it an important epoch in the

history of the text, the basis (so far as can be foreseen) of sub-
sequent criticism.
