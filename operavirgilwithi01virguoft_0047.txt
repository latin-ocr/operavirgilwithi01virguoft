II. THE TEXT OF VIRGIL. Xliii

tendency which marks Renaissance commentaries on Virgil ; and
later ages have had to sift the wheat of grammatical and anti-
quarian lore from much chaff of allegory and mysticism. Ortho-
graphy (see below sect. ΙΙΙ.) was purified of much accumulated bar-
barism: and the efforts of the Renaissance scholars in this direction
deserve all praise, though more recent knowledge has detected flaws
in the ‘conventional ⁷ system which they introduced and which has
held its own almost to the present day.

Among the scholars of the age of Lorenzo the leading names
are those of Pico della Mirandola (1463—1494), the gifted exponent
(and victim) of the fancies of the Hebrew Cabbala ; Marsilio
Ficino, the student of Platonic philosophy3 Cristoforo Landino
(1424—1504), Professor of Latin literature (Rhetoric and Poetry), a
copious annotator of Virgil and Horace, though now better known
as an editor of Dante 3 and Angelo Poliziano, whose name is as
representative of letters in the last half of the 15th century, as that
of Poggio in its earlier part, or Cardinal Bembo in the first half of
the 16th century. Poliziano (i.e. of Montepulciano, Latinised to

. ‘ Politianus' and re-Italianised), born in 1454, became Professor of

Greek and Latin at Florence about 1480. His farne as lecturer,
scholar, and writer of Latin poetry eclipsed all his contemporaries,
and gave him a virtual dictatorship of the world of letters. His
connection with Virgilian learning has been alluded to above
(sect. A. p. xxiii). Equally eminent as scholar, critic, and writer of
Latin poetry was Pietro Bembo (b. 1470, d. 1547), a noble Venetian,
secretary to Pope Leo X, after whose death in 1521 he retired to
a literary and learned life at Padua, where he accumulated a rich
library: but in 1539 returned to Rome on being made a Cardinal
by Pope Paul ΙΙΙ, The Cod. Vaticanus of Virgil was once his
property (p. xxii); but the celebrated ‘ Cod. Bembinus ² of Terence
(4th or 5th century) in the Vatican Library takes its name from
one Bernardo Bembo, probably a relative.

Collection of materials for future criticism was thus the chief
work of the Renaissance scholars: their own restoration of Latin
texts being liable to much uncertainty. Thus, their aim being to
restore a readable text rather than the ‘ipsissima verba' of the
writer, they often fill up lacunae in MSS, especially in the case of
poets, where their own practice in Latin versification tempted
them to supply what was lacking. The text of V irgil was inde-
pendent of their aid ; but more corrupt texts were frequently
interpolated by them : see e. g. Munro on Lucretius (Notes Ι.) 111.
