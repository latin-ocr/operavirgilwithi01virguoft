lii INTRODUCTION.

(b) ‘—es' rather than ‘-is.’

The preponderance of MS. testimony is generally considered
to be in favour of ‘-is.’ But on inspection of the Eclogues
and Georgics in Conington’s and Ribbeck's text I find the form
‘-es' in seventy or eighty different words ; some of them several
times over, and some of the more common words (as ‘cives,'
‘puppes‚' ‘vires,' ‘ fruges ²) in a majority of cases where they occur.
I find, t00, that where Ribbeck's text gives ‘-es,’ he seldom cites
MS. authority for ‘-is 3 ' while in a large number of cases where
his text gives ‘-is,' the MSS. are more or less divided and the
form ‘-es' has more or less support: so that where MSS. do
support ‘-es ⁷ it is with a more decided voice. This form has thus
a firm ‘locus standi' in the text t and we may ask whether, con-
sidering the gain of distinguishing between gen. sing. and nom.‚
acc. plur., and the fact that in the period immediately succeeding
Virgil's time such distinction became established, we are not
justified in giving his text the benefit of it, and removing' the (at
first sight) unintelligible variety which that text exhibits in the
editions of Conington and Ribbeck. It is hard to believe that
Virgil himself would have been satisfied with a presentment of his
work, in which the same word is spelt differently in two closely
neighbouring passages. Thus, e.g.——

G. i. 75, 76. Con. has ‘tenuis,' ‘tristis‚' ‘fragilis' The first may
be, the second must be gen. sing, the third must be acc. plur.5
Ribbeck follows Pal. in ‘fragiles'

G. ii. 190—192. Con., Ribb. have ‘fluentis vitis’ (acc. plur.),
‘laticis fertilis⁷ (gen. sing). Med, Gud.‚ b suggest ‘fluentes‚'
Gud.‚ b ‘vites'

G. iii. 33—35. Con. has ‘gentis‚' acc. plur„ and ‘gentis,' gen.
sing. For the first Ribb. has ‘gentes,' citing only c for ‘gentis :'
for the second Rom. 1 and Pal. give ‘ gentes,' showing how careless
MSS. often are in their varieties.

G. i. 354 we have ‘videntes,' 390 ‘carpentes,’ 423 ‘ovantes: ² why
then ‘agentis ⁷ 352 (Rom. c ⁴ agentes ⁷), ‘nantis' 369 (b, c ‘nantes ²),
‘revertentis ignis' 427 (Ribb. ‘revertentes,' only citing Gud.‚ b
for ‘ -is :² ‘ignes' Rom.‚ b, c) ?

G. iii. 198 ‘natantes‚' 220 ‘alternantes :' why ‘volantis’ 181
(‘volantes⁷ Med), ‘sonantis' 184 (‘sonantes’ Rom.), ‘amantis’
218 (‘amantes' Rom„ c)?

G. iii. 235 ‘vires :² why ‘viris' 229 (‘ vires ’ Med.‚ Rom.) and 215
(⁶ vires’ Rom„ b, c)? Vat. is wanting in both : so that Pal. is the
sole evidence for ‘viris'
