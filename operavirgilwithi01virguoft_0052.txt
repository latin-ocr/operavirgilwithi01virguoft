Thus far our course is, or should be, clear. There are, however,
many words and forms in the spelling of which, as Mr. Munro
says, ‘variety was the rule of the ancients 3⁷ whose orthography,
that is, gradually changed during the period from Ennius to the
first century of the Empire, so that inscriptions of that time, and
MSS. of authors that fall within it, present us with varying forms
of the same word, Such fluctuations, it is probable, were still
going on when Virgil wrote, though Cicero had done much to
establish a uniform literary standard of spelling: and it is not
strange that Virgilian MSS. should present us with varying forms.
XVhether Virgil himself, on a final revision of his own work, would
have allowed so great a variety as meets us in modern editions of
his text, is another question, the answer to which can only be
matter of opinion, never of demonstration.

The following list shows the principal heads of varying ortho-
graphy 2-—

ΙΙ. Cases in which ancient usage seems to have varied, especially
in the Augustan age, when changes in literary spelling were in
progress :

(a) Assimilation of prepositions—e. g. ‘ inperium’ or ‘ imperium,
the former representing etymology, the latter pronunciation.
Words in commoner use adopted the latter3 thus MSS. of Virgil
always have ‘imperium‚' but ‘impius' and ‘inpius‚' ‘immortalis'
and ‘inmortalis,³ ‘compleo' and ‘ conpleo' are found 3 ‘exsto ⁷ and
‘ext0,⁷ etc. ; and so in compounds of ‘ab,⁷ ‘ob,’ ‘sub,' ‘ad’

(b) Aecus. plur. in ‘-es' or ‘-is ;' the former being more common
in words of very general use, e. g. ‘ignes,' ‘vires,' ‘aures' [In-
scriptions also give ‘-eis.’]

(c) ⁶ 0’ or ‘u' after ‘v' (i. e. consonantal ‘ u '>. The older Latins
found difficulty in pronouncing ‘uu' (‘ vu '), except where both
sounds were vowel, as in ‘tuusj ‘suus :² and the older ‘0’ long
kept its place after ‘qu,’ or ‘u' (‘v'), the former being some-
times changed to ‘c.' Thus ‘quom' or ‘cum,' not ‘quum3'
‘secuntur' or ‘ sequontur ;' ‘equos' or ‘ecus ;' ‘volvont‚’ ‘novos,'
‘alvos‚³ etc, ; are correct in Plautus and Lucretius. But in Virgil's
time the feeling against ‘quu,' ‘vu' was subsiding, and they were
coming into general use.

(d) ‘u’ or ‘i' where the sound was intermediate between the
two, and the spelling therefore uncertain3 e. g. ‘maxumus' or
‘maximus‚’ ‘lacruma' or ‘ lacrima,' ‘lubet' or ‘libet‚’ ‘inclutus’ or
