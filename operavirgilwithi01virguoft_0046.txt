xlii INTRODUCTION.

existing MS. is older than the 14th century (Teuffel, 211, 9). Of some
2 50 MSS. of Horace, the oldest are of the 9th century : of Tibullus,
none earlier than the 13th; of Ovid, Caesar, Seneca, Juvenal,
Persius, and Q. Curtius, none earlier than the 9th. The fact that
of so many Latin authors (of whom those here mentioned are but
a sample) good, and in most cases the oldest, MSS. date frorn this
period would of itself suggest the inference which history confirms,
that it was a period of marked revival in learning and consequently
in the production or reproduction of means thereto.

(3) To the industry of the Renaissance scholars¹ in collecting
and copying MSS. we are indebted, in the case of Virgil, for our
best materials for the text (see above sect. A, on Codd. Vat., Med„
Pal, Rom. and fragm. Aug), and in the case of many writers for
its very existence. Thus Poggio Bracciolini, while attending the
Council of Constance in 1414 as Apostolic Secretary, explored the
libraries of Swiss and Swabian convents, discovering many lost
works, and full texts of others hitherto only known in mutilated
copies. At St. Gall he found an entire MS. of Quintilian, of whose
writings only half had been known before in a corrupt text. This
he copied with his own hand, and also MSS. of Lucretius and
Columella : and to him was owing the discovery of Silius Italicus,
Vitruvius, Manilius, Frontinus, and others. This work of collect-
ing had been begun by Petrarch and Boccaccio 3 and it was carried
on throughout the 15th century, especially under the patronage of
the Medici at Florence. The fruit of their enlightened liberality
was the famous ‘Laurentian' library, founded by Cosmo de Medici
about 1440, enlarged by his son Piero, and further enlarged by
(and named after) the great Lorenzo, who swept the monasteries
of Greece for Greek MSS. The chief work of learned men at
Florence during the age of Lorenzo was the elucidation and cor-
rection of ancient texts, written by ignorant and careless copyists,
or obscured by dirt and damp in neglected lumber—rooms of
monasteries. Until the invention of printing (1450) fixed the text
of whole editions, the critical amendments of such scholars could
only be made useful through their oral lectures; notes taken at
which are probably the basis of·many of the diffuse commentaries
found in the older editions. The accepted notion that every great
poem must have a hidden meaning encouraged the allegorising
