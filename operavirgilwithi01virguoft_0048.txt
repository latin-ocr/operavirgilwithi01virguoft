E. Printed. Editions ¹.

Some idea of the rapid multiplicatiori of Virgilian texts by the
agency of printing may be formed from the fact that, from the
appearance of the ‘Editio Princeps' at Rome in 1469 until the
year 1600, there are only seven years in which no fresh edition of
Virgil is recorded, while many years are credited with two, three,
or more 3 mainly from the presses of Venice, Milan, Florence, and
Rome, though in the 16th century we find mention of Paris,
Leipzig, Antwerp‚ Amsterdam, and London. The first English
edition whose date can be determined appeared in 1512 from the
press of Wynkin de VVorde, and was followed by those of 1514,
1516, and 1533: but mention is made of a ‘vetus Londinensis
editio,' published by Pynson, a printer in London between 1493
and 1528, which may have been older.

The ‘Editio Princeps' was published at Rome in 1469 ‘sub
auspiciis Paulli II. in domo Petri de Maximo per Conradum et
Arnoldum Teutonicos,' and was repeated in 1471, 550 copies in
all (275 of each issue> being printed, of which (according to Heyne
and Wagner) only six were known to exist in 1832, the best being
in the library of St. Genevieve at Paris. The editions of the 15th
century, though in some cases professing to follow good MSS, are
but of slight critical value. Several editions appeared from the
Aldine press at Venice in 1501 and subsequent years. Among
later editions of importance were those of De la Cerda (Madrid
1608-1617), a commentary in 3 vols. ; Nicholas Heinsius (Amster-
dam 1676); Burmann, with comments of Servius, Philargyrius,
Nicholas Heinsius, etc. in 4 vols. <Amsterdam 1746); Heyne, in
4 vols. (Leipzig) 1st ed. 1767—1775: 2nd 1788: 3rd 1798—1800 (in
5 vols) : 4th, edited by Wagner, 1830—1832, including Philip VVag-
ner’s ‘Quaestiones 'Virgilianae’ (vol. iv. pp. 383—587), the foundation
of much recent Virgilian criticism. The title of this Heyne-Wagner

¹ The information here given is mainly derived from Vol. iv. of Heyne's
Virgil (ed. Wagner, 18 32), pp. 635—749 ‘De Virgilii Editionibus.'
