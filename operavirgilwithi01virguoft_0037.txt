II. THE TEXT OF VIRGIL. xxxiii

history, (4) religious or political antiquities. He advocated the
readings ‘limo' in Aen. xii. 120, ‘amaror' G. ii. 247, citing in
each case the authority of a MS. ‘ex domo atque ex familia
Vergiliiz’ and noticed the confusion of two historical personages
in Aen. vi. 837, the anachronism of Velia vi. 359, and the
inconsistency between the mentions of Theseus in vi. 122 and
617. Servius quotes him also on Aen. i. 277, 530 ; ii. 15 3 vii. 47 :
and his works ‘De Urbibus Italicis⁷ and ‘ De Familiis Trojanis’
(Roman samilies claiming descent from Troy) were used by later
commentators.

4. IULIUS MODESTUS, a freedman of Hyginus, commended as a
grammarian by Charisius, wrote a commentary on Horace, and
scattered remarks upon Virgil. Martial x. 21 implies his eminence
as a scholar : ‘ Scribere te, quae vix intelligat ipse Modestus.7

5. L. ANNAEUS CORNUTUS, a philosopher and grammarian, and
the teacher of Persius and Lucan, wrote a commentary on Virgil
which he dedicated to the poet Silius Italicus, an imitator and
devoted admirer of Virgil (Martial xi. 48, Plin. Epp. iii. 7, 8).
From specimens of his notes quoted in the Verona Scholia and
by Servius, he seems to have been hypercritical on small points ;
objecting, e.g. to the expressions ‘vexasse ’ Ecl. vi. 76, ‘illaudati' G.
iii. 5, ‘auro squalentem' Aen. x. 314, (Gell. ii. 6) etc. He read
‘inflexit' Aen. i. 45, ‘multa nocte’ ix. 348: and in ix, 675 in-
terpreted ‘ commissa' as = ‘ clausa.' Macrobius, v. 19. 2, tells us
that he objected to the conclusion of Aen. iv. as inartistic.

6. AEMILIUS ASPER, grammarian and commentator on Terence,
Sallust, and Virgil; later than Cornutus, against whom he wrote
(Ver. Schol. on Aen. iii. 691), and probably than Probus (see
below); though some infer, from a statement in Ver. Schol. on
Aen. ix. 373 that Rrobus replied to Asper's interpr. of ‘sublustris,’
that Asper was the earlier. He was ‘tenax traditae lectionis ⁷——
e.g. ‘armis ² Aen. x. 539, ‘quosne’ 673, ‘viris' 737, ‘auras’ (gen.)
xi. 801 : and his comments are scholarlike, even where not con-
vincing. On Aen. ix. 498 he points out that ‘per'=‘inter;⁷ ix.
386 ‘imprudens’=‘ignorans se evasisse3' G. ii. 324 ‘terrae'
nom. plur. Less convincing are his interpretations of ‘crimen
vestrum' Aen. x. 188 as ‘causa vestrae mutationis ;' ‘picti' iv, 146
‘tattooed3' ‘armati ferro’ ix. 678 as=‘ferrea corda habentes.’
The notes assigned to Asper by the Verona Scholia or Philargy-
rius (below, No. 17) are on ‘sinum’ Ecl. vii. 33, ‘infelicis Ulixi'
Aen. iii. 691, ‘ Camarina' ib. 701, ‘exin' vii. 341, ix. 360-3, ‘sub-
lustris' ib. 373, ‘imprudens' ib. 386, ‘quianam’ x, 6, ‘non nullius
