J. LIFE AND POEMS OF VIRGIL. XXV

questioned3 a change of feeling towards him, which is rightly
referred by Prof. Sellar¹ to the great advance made by Greek
scholarship in modern times. Just as in Virgil's own time in-
creased familiarity with Greek masterpieces made the Romans
depreciate their own earlier efforts (as may be seen e. g. in Hor.
Epp. ii. 1), so in our own day increased familiarity with the older
literature has produced a reaction against what at first sight is
only a reproduction of Greek originals. As the debt which Virgil
owes to his Greek masters became more apparent, the individuality
of his own genius was for a time obscured. Comparison with
Homer, which was probably the secret of Virgil’s own dissatisfaction
with the Aeneid, has produced the disparaging criticisms of modern
scholars. Niebuhr thought the whole of the Aeneid ‘a miscon-
ceived idea ε’ Coleridge asked what was left to Virgil, if diction
and metre were removed: Carlyle considered that the matter of
his writings ‘must have appeared frigid and shallow to a mind so
susceptible⁷ as Schiller’s: Keble asks admiration for him only as
a poet of outward nature : and even the late Professor Conington,
to whom English students of Virgil owe a deep debt of gratitude,
while holding Virgil ‘heavily chargeable' for the corruption of
pastoral poetry, is inclined (against Keble) to suspect the reality
of his sympathy with external nature in the Georgics, and takes it
for granted that ‘in undertaking the Aeneid at the command of a
superior, Virgil was venturing beyond the province of his genius!
Still more formidable is the battery of German criticism (see
above, p. xxii. note).

12. Now if we look at the literary standpoint of Virgil's own
time, it seems that the imitation which is so obvious a feature
in his work was not so much the result of any want of original
power as an inevitable accident of his time and literary surround-
ings. No poet or artist of any kind can ever leave out of count
the works of his predecessors. However great his own creative
power, he cannot keep clear of the antecedents of his own art:
and no one, for example, would blame Milton for absorbing into
his poetry much of the form and spirit of Classical and of Italian
writings. It is not the imitation of other poets that offends us in
Virgil, but the fact that his imitations seem osten to modern taste
so crude and obvious. Prof. Nettleship truly points out that ‘the
kind of crude and externa] imitation which we find in Virgil is
characteristic of all the serious Roman poetry: Ennius imitates
