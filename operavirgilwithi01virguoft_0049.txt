II. THE TEXT OF VIRGJL. le

edition is ‘ P. Virgili Maronis carmina ad pristinam orthographiam
revocata ς’ and its text represents the first systematic attempt to
rescue the text of Virgil from the errors of the ‘conventional’
system of orthography introduced by the Italian scholars of the
Renaissance, the principles on which it proceeds being expounded
in Wagner's ‘Orthographia Virgiliana' published in 1841. Of
this work Mr. Munro says, ‘ With admirable industry he (Wagner)
amassed all the evidence afforded by the Medicean and, so far as
it was accessible to him, of the other ancient MSS. of Virgil. As
these, like other old MSS, are as a rule very tenacious of the true
spelling in those cases where there is only one right method‚ he
performed this part of his work with eminent success, and still
remains one of the best authorities on the subject. In those other
cases, however, . . . in which variety is the rule of the ancients,
and which include a great multitude of particular instances‚ he
has chosen to abandon the safe ground of evidence and experience
and has made Virgil write what he decided on a priori principles
he must have written. This seems to me the reason why his
system was not more generally followed.' XVagner's orthography
has not, perhaps, been followed in Germany: but in England the
preeminence in recent years of Coningt0n⁷s edition (in which it is
reproduced with but little change) has made it the standard
orthography for Virgil; Ribbeck's elaborate collation of MSS.
being as yet familiar only to a comparatively small circle of
scholars in this country. In Part III. of this Introduction 1 have
endeavoured to explain my reasons for departing in some respects
not only from WVaQer's system as represented by Conington's
text, but from some of the more scientific results of Ribbeck’s
accumulation of MS. evidence.

The following enumeration of the points treated of (some of
them at great length and with much minute illustration) in &Nag-
ner's ‘Quaestiones Virgilianae' will show how wide and various
was his study of Virgilian usage :

i, ii. On the forms ‘ab,' ‘ex' before consonants.

iii. Accusative of proper nameS‚ ⁶ -an‚' ‘ -en’ tGreek)‚ ‘-i1n,‘ not ‘-in‚' etc.

iv. Greek forms ⁴-os,' ⁵ -on ’ (‘Arctos‚’ ‘Spercheios‚’ ‘ Aegyptos‚' etc.)

v. Termination of 3 plur. perf. act„ ‘-ere' preferred to ‘-erunt,’ where
the metre was unaffeeted, e. g. at the end of a line.

vi. Confusion of Moods and Tenses.

vii-x. Interchange in MSS. of present and perfect ; of sing. and plur. in
verbs; of case and number in nouns; of ‘ad ’ and ‘in.’

xi, xii. Hiatus; and lengthening of short syllables in ἰιι-εἰς each ex-
haustively illustrated.
