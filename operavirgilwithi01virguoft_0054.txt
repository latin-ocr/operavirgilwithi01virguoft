l INTRODUCTION.

possible the existing MS. evidence, and from it make the best
approximation to what the author nglzt have written, taking as a
rule the oldest form for which evidence, direct or indirect, is forth-
coming. For a purely critical edition, such as Ribbeck's, whose
aim is not commentary but textual crsticism, this is the only
reliable method: and the system adopted by Wagner in cases
of varying orthography—viz. to decide on a priori principles what
Virgil must have written—is justly condemned by Mr. Munro, in
his Introduction to Part I. of his notes to Lucretius, as involving
him in ‘ a sea of conjectural uncertainty.'

(4) It seems, therefore, that the most obvious and the safest
course for an editor who does not profess a first—hand study of
MSS. is, to adopt the latest results of critical investigation‚ and
reprint e.g. Ribbeck's text of Virgil, as Conington (in matters of
orthography) does that of Wagner, or as an editor of Lucretius
(were there now any room for him) would reproduce that of Lach-
mann or Munro. But Ribbeck's work, invaluable for its careful
and patient collection of materials for textual criticisrn, is dis·
figured (as I cannot but think) by much arbitrary transposition of
lines, much unwarrantable suspicion of genuineness, and undue
licence in the tempting but slippery field of conjectural emendation,
accompanied sometimes by a curious insensibility to poetical
feeling or even to common sense¹. His text must, Ι conceive, be
the basis for any fresh edition; but to reproduce it as it stands
seems impossible.

A further question then occurs: Is it necessary, in dealing with
the writings of a Latin classic for educational purposes‚ to maintain
all the variety of spelling which MSS. undoubtedly exhibit—a
variety so great that in an English classic we could not, and should
not, tolerate it? Granted that in Virgil's time pronunciation had
not completely tn'umphed over etymology in the assimilation of
prepositions ; that the varying forms ‘-is’ and ‘-es' for nom., acc.
plur. of ‘i’ and consonant stems were still in use ; that the feeling
against the combination ‘uu' (‘ vu ³) was not yet extinct 3 and that
‘maxumus' and ‘vorto' still held their ground beside ‘maximus’

¹ Illustrations of this may be found in Professor Conington’s remarks on
Ribbeek’s prolegomena appended to vol. iii. of his edition of Virgil. A
typical example is Aen. xii. 55, where, in the descn‘ption of Amata, sels-
doomed to death, and clasping Turnus for the last time, ‘ardentem generum
moritura tenebat,² Ribbeck, in defiance of MS. authority, reads moni·
tura, ‘with intent to advise,' a singularly inappropriate word for the im·
passioned appeal which follows.
