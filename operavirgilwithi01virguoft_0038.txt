xxxiv INTRODUCTION.

numinis’ G. iv. 453. Some of these are found abridged in Servius,
who quotes much from Terence and Sallust, on which authors
Asper especially wrote3 and it is probable that much of Asper’s
criticism is embodied without acknowledgment in that of Servius.

7. M. VALERIUS PROBUS, of Berytus (Beyrout), temp. Domitian,
was alive in 88 A.D. (as appears from Martial iii. 2. 12), and was
recognised as a learned scholar 30 years before. His remarks
on the text of Virgil are of value, as based on good MSS.—e. g.
one of G. i. corrected by the poet⁷s own hand (Gell. xiii. 21. 4).
Thus he defended ‘floros ’ Aen. xii. 605, and ‘Phoebigenam ² vii.
773·: and Nonius cites him for ‘tempore' i. 44, ‘umbrae' i. 441,
(citing Sallust Hist. ii. 91), ‘ infusum' viii. 406, ‘ aeger' (for ‘acer ⁷)
ix. 814, ‘ Horcus' G. i. 277.

He wrote ‘Aiiax,’ ‘Troiia' ete„ according to a grammarian's rule,
which never obtained general currency. He is frequently cited
on questions of interpretation and grammar3 and appears to have
introduced the use of the Alexandrian ‘notae’ (obelus, asterisk
ete.)—see Ribb. Prol. pp. 149—163.

The name of Probus, as a celebrated grammarian, is rather
loosely used by later writers, and it is by no means certain that
everything ascribed to him is really his. Thus the commentary
on Ecl. and Georg. which bears his name deals chiefly with
points of history, geography, and mythology: whereas Probus
confined himself to textual and grammatica] criticism.

8. FLAVIUS CAPER‚ temp. Trajan, wrote grammatica] treatises,
in which he drew examples from Virgil, making use of Probus. Afew
remarks of his are quoted by Servius—e. g. Aen. vi. 545 ‘ explebo ²
=‘ minuam,’ ix. 709 ‘ clipeum ⁷ a neut. nom., xii. 120 ‘limo’

9. VELIUS LONGUS, temp. Trajan, wrote a commentary on the
Aeneid, mentioned by Charisius (pp. 88, 175 ed. Keil). Much of
it is preserved in Macrobius and the Verona Scholia (see below 15),
and probably in Servius, who abridges notes quoted by Ver. Schol.
as from Longus—eg. on Aen. iii. 693 ‘Plemyrium' der. from
πλημμυρία, 705 ‘palmosa'=‘mother of victors‚' iv. 149 ‘segnis’=
‘sine igne,’ x. 557 ‘istic ⁷ illustrated from Plaut.‚ Rud. i. 2. 43.

10. URBANUS‚ acc. to Ribbeck (Prol. p. 167), was prior to
Longus: but this seems doubtful. He is not mentioned in the
Verona Scholia, which even in their fragmentary state preserve
the names of most grammarians3 and the remarks attributed to
him point to a later and degenerate age of scholarship.

11. TERENTIUS SCAURUS, ‘Hadriani temporibus grammaticus
vel nobilissimus' (Gell. xi. 15. 3), wrote treatises on the art of
