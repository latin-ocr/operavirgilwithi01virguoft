xxxii INTRODUCTION.

living sense of the meaning of words which the student of a dead
language cannot have—he cannot safely be set aside as valueless :
and a respectful hearing is at least due to testimony which may
rest ultimately upon other'and better materials than those of our
MSS. or existing knowledge. To take a single example, where
in the difficult passage Aen: ix. 486, Servius tells us that ‘ sunera’
is fem. of a lost adject. ‘funerus,' analogous to ‘celera' from
‘celerus,' and supports it by the authority of Ennius, we cannot
but feel that this is at least probable. Or when on G. i. 461, he
explains ‘serenas⁷=‘siccas,’ (an interpr. also found in Nonius),
and we recall Lucretius' use of ‘seresco² (i. 306), ‘gToxv dry,'
there is certainly a presumption in his favour. And though
testimony of this kind is mainly valuable for interpretation of the
text, it cannot be altogether valueless for the determination of the
text itself.

With these few words of preface to justify the space given to a
subject which is not much noticed in existing commentaries, I
proceed to enumerate some of the leading names in early Vir-
gilian criticism. The information here given is derived mainly
from Ribbeck’s ‘Prolegomenaj ch. ix,Teuffe1’s ‘History of Roman
Literature‚' and lectures delivered at Oxford hythe Corpus Pro—
fessor of Latin (Mr. Nettleship).

B. Ancient Commentators

1. Q. CAECILms EPIROTA, a freedman of Cicero's friend Atticus,
and tutor to his daughter Pomponia, who married Agrippa, be-
came a friend of Cornelius Gallus (see Ecl. x); after whose
condemnation and death in B.C. 28, he opened a school, in which
he read and lectured upon Virgil—the earliest record of such use
of the poet's works. He does not appear to have attempted any
regular commentary.

2. ASINIUS POLLIO (see Dict. Biogr.), the friend of Virgil and
Horace, is cited by Servius as a commentator upon Virgil: but
the character of the criticisrns ascribed to him (Ribb. Prol. ix.
ᾧ 2, p. 116) is hardly worthy of his reputation in the field of tragic
poetry; on which see Ecl. iii. 86 sqq., viii. 10 ; Hor. Od. ii. 1. 14,
Sat. i. 10. 42.

3. C. IULIUS HYGINUS, a freedman of Augustus, friend of Ovid,
and head of the Palatine Library (Suet. de Ill. Gramm. 20). Gell.
i. 21, xvi. 6, 15, mentions his commentaries on Virgil; but it is
doubtful whether these were continuous, or (more probably)
scattered remarks on (1) text, (2) interpretation of language, (3)
