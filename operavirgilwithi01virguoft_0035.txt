II. THE TEXT OF VIRGJL. XXXi

apparent advantages of number and variety: while the fact that
Virgil’s writings became a school—book within fifty years of his
death, and consequently were copied and recopied over and over
again, adds much to the possibility of corruption through the
carelessness or ignorance of copyists. And the positive 011015-
grammatical‚ metrical‚ or othographical—which are found even in
the best extant MSS„ indicating as these do a decline of scholar-
ship at the period to which the said MSS. belong, give some idea
of the liability to corruption to which the text must have been
exposed. As an instructive specimen of such errors we may take
G. iii. 181-214‚ a passage represented in the four great uncial
MSS. (F. M. P. R.) and the ‘ Augustean' fragment (A). In about
thirty lines we find the following—182 ⁶ et qui ⁷ for ‘equi' (A.>: 183
‘bella tantum' for ‘bellantum' (F. 1); 184 ‘audere’ for ‘audire'
(M. 1) ; 188 ‘audiat' for ‘audeat’ <Rom.‚ Med. 2); 192 ‘quae’ for
‘que' (Rom.)‚ ‘currum' for ‘crurum' (Med. 1>; 193 ‘quae' for
‘que’ (Rom), ‘auris' (Pal.) 3 201 ‘ fugas' sor ‘fuga' (Rom.) 3 202
⁴ Aelei' for ‘Elei⁷ (Rom.>; 209 ‘vela' for ‘ ulla' (A.); 212 ‘insula’
for ‘in sola’ (Pal.); ‘religant' for ‘relegant' (Rom.); 213 ‘nata'
for ‘lata’ (Med.). The proportion and character of the mistakes
here attributed to Rom. (R.) quite bear out, it may be observed
in passing, the estimate formed by Ribbeck of its comparative
value.

This being the case with regard to the evidence of MSS„ the
student of Virgilian criticism must enquire further what help is to
be got from ancient commentaries. The rapid and continuous
popularity of Virgil’s poems, especially for educational purposes,
made them the favourite text-book of teachers and grammarians
throughout the Imperial times, and the basis of an innumerable
number of treatises‚ grammatical, exegetical, and linguistic. Many
of these survive only in scattered references in the works of the
later and better preserved among them (eg. Servius) ε but it is
probable that more of the common material of the scholarship of
the Ist century A. D. has been preserved by later grammarians
than at first sight appears. Much of the accumulated store of
Virgilian learning available for Servius 01 the writers of the Verona
Scholia belonged probably to the time of Trajan or earlier: and
so far as this earlier learning is imbedded in the notes of later
commentators, their testimony may be of greater value than if it
only belonged to the actual time at which they wrote. If Servius,
for example, embodies for us the opinion of scholars of the Ist

century on points of interpretation—of men, that is, who had that
