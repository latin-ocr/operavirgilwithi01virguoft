II. THE TEX T OF VIRGIL. xxxvii

C. Other Ancient Testimony to the Text.

(1) Imitations by later poets—Statius, Silius Italicus, Valerius
Flaccus, Claudian, etc„ sometimes offer corroborative evidence to
Virgil's meaning, and even to his text3 but such testimony is aster
all but scanty and uncertain.

(2) Quotations by later writers—e. g. Pliny, Quintilian, Colu-
mella, Seneca—are not often trustworthy in cases of disputed
reading: for they frequently cite from memory, and seldom with
any desire to preserve the e'xact text by reference to a good MS.
Ribbeck⁷s cantion with respect to one such writer may be ex-
tended to all. ‘Quintilianum cave credas, ubicumque verba Ver—
gilii inseruit‚ manum poetae religiose reddere) Pliny indeed (N. H.
xiii. 12, 26) and Quintilian (Ι. Ο. i. 7. 20) speak of having seen
Virgil’s own MS.; and Gellius tells us (N. A. ii. 3. 5) that a cer-
tain Fidus Optatus, a grammarian of high repnte at Rome, showed
him ‘librum Aeneidos secundum mirandae vetustatis, emptum in
Sigillariis xx aureis, quem ipsius Vergilii fuisse credebat;' in
which over the word ‘aena' (Aen. ii. 470) was written (whether
by the same or by a later hand he does not tell us, and probably did
not notice) the letter ‘h‚' making the word ‘ahena.' Such testi—
mony, however interesting, is obviously of little scientific value.

The number of extant ‘verbatim’ citations from Virgil in
writers of the first few centuries A.D. is very large, and Ribbeck
(Prol. p. 203) estimates that if all continuous copies of Virgil had
perished, the greater part might be pieced together from such
citations ε just as in the case of the Greek Testament it has been
said that if every copy had perished, and only the Patristic quo-
tations remained, together with a copy of some one ‘version' as
an index of arrangement, we might reconstruct the whole. But if
the citations of the Fathers in their vast abundance (Origen alone
cites nearly every verse of the N. T.) are of slight independent
value for determining the text of the New Testament, equally is
this true of the ‘grammatici ⁷ who quote Virgil : and it is probable
that the constant handling of his poems by teachers and rhetori—
cians of every degree has if anything been injurious to the text,
which has suffered not only from the mischances of incorrect
copying, but from what Ribbeck calls the ‘ignorantia et stupor
magistellorum ’ and ‘librariorum incredibilis oscitantia.'

The authorities which deserve special mention under this head
