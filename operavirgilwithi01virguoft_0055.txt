HI. ORTHOGRAPHY. li

and ‘verto '—is it therefore necessary or desirable to maintain in
Virgil's text, on the evidence of MSS. written long after his time,
such variations as ‘impius' ‘ inpius‚’ ‘navis' ‘naves,' ‘volnus ²
‘vulnus‚' ‘lacruma' ‘lacrima,' ‘vortex' ‘ vertex'? Can we feel that
the poet himself would have tolerated such irregularity¹: or at
least that there is any improbability in retaining in his text only
one of two varying forms ?

Ι have ventured to answer these questions in the negative with
regard to most of the cases of varying orthography that fall under
the heads above given in List II (p. xlviii) ; and to write throughout
‘impius‚' ‘compleo,’ ‘immortalis,' ‘irrigo‚' ‘ colligo‚’ etc. 3 ‘-es' in
nom.‚ acc. plur. of adjectives and substantives of ‘i' and cons. stems‚
and participles 3 ‘ equus‚' ‘linquunt‚⁷ ‘vulnus‚' ‘ vulgo,² ete. ; ‘maxi-
mus,' ‘svert0‚' etc.² The two heads which embrace the greatest
number of departures from the orthography now familiar in Con—
ington’s text are those of ‘vu' (‘ uu ³) instead of ‘vo-‚² and ‘-es'
instead of ‘-is,’ in nom.‚ acc, plur.: and in both these cases an
examination of the MS. testimony collected by Ribbeck goes
further than might have been expected to justify the course taken.
I subjoin a few examples of the testimony of uncial MSS. on this
point.

(a) ‘ vu ' rather than ‘ vo z '—

Ecl. iii. 73 ‘divum' Rom. (the only uncial MS. which gives the
passage).

G. i. 238 ‘divum' Med, Rom., Gud., b, c and Pal. 2 z ‘divom'
Pal. 1 [Vat. wanting].

G. i. 452 ‘vultu’ Med„ Rom., b: ‘voltu' Gud. (corrected to
‘vultu ') ; [Vat., Pal.‚ Rom. wanting].

G. iii. 4 (a passage occurring in five out of the seven uncials—
FMPRV) ‘vulgata' Vat.‚ Med, Rom., Ver.: ‘volgata' Pal.

G. iii. 221 ‘vulneribus ² Med„ Rom., Gud., b, c : ‘ volneribus' Pal.
[Vat. wanting].

G. iii. 246 ‘vulgo' Med„ Rom., b, c: ‘volgo’ Pal.‚ Gud. 1 [Vat.
wanting].

The chief MS. authority for ‘vo' appears to be Pal.‚ to which
Ribbeck assigns the highest importance : but it must be conceded
that ‘ vu' has considerable MS. support.

² The form ‘olle,' deliberately introduced as an archaism side by side
with the later ‘ ille,' does not affect the point.
² This line, I see, has been adopted in a neat and handy little edition of
the text, based on Ribbeck's, and published in Messrs. Rivington’s series of
¹ Latin Texts.’
