II. THE TEXT OF VIRGIL. xli

‘Flavius Eutropius emendavi sine exemplario, Constantino III,
Valentiniano Augusto VII. coss.'——i. e. in 450 A. D.

To this period belong, as has been shown, the MSS. of leading
authority for the text of Virgil.

From the oth to the 8th centuries public libraries tended to
disappear, and books were collected in monasteries, the founders
of which were anxious to get books,—in the first instance Christian
literature, but others as well, especially historians and mytholo-
gists or their epitomators ; grammarians ; works on geography or
natural history; and some poets, e.g. Virgil and Horace for edu-
cational purposes, Juvenal, Persius, and Seneca as moralists. The
most famous among many great monastic libraries were, in Italy,
at Verona (the Chapter Library) 3 at Bobbio or BobiO, founded by
Columbanus in 612, a great library, many of whose MSS. are now
at Rome, Turin, Naples, etc. ; and the Benedictine library at
Monte Cassino, founded 529 A. D., the cradle of monastic trans-
cription of ancient books. In Switzerland were the Benedictine
library at St. Gall, founded 613 A. D., and that at Lorsch, whence
came the Cod. ‘ Laurishamiensis' (now ‘ Vindobonensis ') of the 5th
century, our sole authority for the last five existing books of Livy.
In Germany were that of Fulda, founded by Boniface 3 and Saltz—
burg, a 14th century catalogue of which mentions copies of the
chief Latin classics. France possessed the Benedictine library at
Corbey, founded 660 A. D., and St. Germain des Pres : Spain those
of Seville and Toledo : while even in England the libraries of
York and Whitby contained a considerable variety of learning.

(2) In the Carolingian period we hear ofa fresh start in correct-
ing and editing, first Bibles and Prayerbooks, then other literature ;
marked, among other signs, by ‘subscriptiones' to MSS.—e. g. to
one of St. Augustine at Corbey ‘relegi,⁷ and to the Cod. Vindo—
bonensis of Livy ‘recognovi' The demand for multiplication of
copies of the classics was met by a class of ‘ antiquarii,' or writers
of Classical texts, many of them inmates of the great monasteries ;
and large numbers of MSS. in ‘cursive' handwriting remain to
attest the copying industry of the 9th and following centuries.
Those of Virgil, which have already been spoken of (II. A, p. xxiii),
are but of minor importance in the history of his text : but in the case
of many Latin authors, these later MSS. are our earliest evidence.
Thus e. g. of Lucretius there are two leading MSS.--‘ Leidensis' I.
(A) of the 9th century, and ‘ Leidensis' ΙΙ. (Β) not later than the 10th
century 3 all the Italian MSS. being of the 15th century. Of
Catullus there is evidence of a single archetype, but no actually
