III. ORTHOGRAPHY. xlix

‘inclitus' (such forms as ‘lacryma‚⁷ ‘inclytus' are wrong) ; ‘o' or
‘e' in ‘vorto,’ ‘vert0‚' ‘vorteX,' ‘vertexj eto: ‘i’ or ‘e' in ‘pro-
tinus ² or ‘protenus,’ etc.

Ribbeck also writes ‘haut‚' ‘set‚' ‘aput’ as well as the ordinary
forms in ‘·d:' ‘ps' as well as ‘bs' in forms like ‘obstipui‚' ‘ obsto,'
etc.; and always ‘supter ι’ ‘quoi’ as well as ‘cui ε’ and, where
‘est ' follows a vowel or ‘m,’ ‘necessest‚’ ‘ventumst‚⁷ etc. as usual
in Plautus. But though all these forms had existed (see Ramsay's
Introd. to Plautus, ‘Mostellaria ³), it is not clear that they were
employed in Virgil's time.

In dealing with such cases more than one course is open to us.

(1) We may ignore scientific orthography and the evidence of
inscriptions, and adopt the ‘ conventional’ spelling of the Renais—
sance scholars, as it appears in ordinary grammars and text-books,
leaving all questions connected with the history of changes in
orthography for separate and more advanced study. This method‚
however, would commit us to so many positive and ascertainable
errors (as indicated above), that it would in the present state of
scholarship be simply retrograde.

(2) We may profess, from the evidence of MSS. and inscriptions,
to reproduce the orthography of Yirgil's own time, and present the
poems as nearly as possible in the shape in which they came from
his hand. But can we do this? Inscriptions, no doubt, supply
contemporary evidence : but in an age of transition in orthography,
considerable deduction must be made for the ignorance or care-
lessness of the persons employed to cut them. The oldest existing
MSS. were written 350 years after Virgil's time, and it is obvious
that their testimony to the actual character of his own MS. can be
little more than inference, more or less weakened by the chance of
variety and error in successive generations of copyists. And the
authority of gmmmarians, though it may date back to a time much
nearer Virgil's own, is but of little value. They had all the dog-
matism and love of theory of the most dogmatic modern scholar,
with less than his opportunities of critical and philological know-
ledge : their statements upon matters of orthography are often
very unscientific : and the text of their writings, moreover, is usually
more corrupt than that of the great classics. Turn which way
we will, it seems useless to pretend to reproduce the text exactly as
Virgil wrote it.

(3) A sounder method is that inaugurated by Lachmann on
LucretiUS, and since followed by Ritschl on Plautus, Ribbeck on
Virgil, and a host of German scholars—viz. to sift as carefully as
