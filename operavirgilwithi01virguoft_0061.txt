JV. THE VIRGILIAN HEXAMETER. lvii

ditions under which the metre could be adapted to Roman usage
had yet to be discovered: caesura, cadence, proportion—all the
niceties of rhythm which combine to form the charm of Virgil’s
verse—were to him unknown. The rude and tentative imitation
of a great model by a vigorous and powerful hand struck out
indeed here and there a line which Virgil did not disdain to
borrow (e. g. ‘ Tuque pater Tiberine tuo cum flumine sancto ²), or a
passage of grave solemnity‚ as the lament for Romulus—
‘0 Romule, Romule die,
Qualem te patriae custodem di genuerunt!

O pater o genitor 0 sanguen dis oriundum,
Tu produxisti nos intra luminis oras’ (Enn. Ann. 115-118):

but it also produced much that was harsh and abhorrent to the
culture of after years (see Hor. A. P. 258 sqq), and much that
could scarcely be distinguished from prose. But in settling the
quantity of Latin words and moulding them into forms suitable for
hexameter verse he paved the way for others, and was deservedly

reverenced as the pioneer
‘qui primus amoeno

Detulit ex Helicone perenni fronde coronam’ (Lucr. i. 117).

5. Lucretius marks a great advance upon Ennius, though in
some respects his rhythmis (perhaps intentionally) more archaic
than that of his contemporary Catullus ;, whose hexameters, how—
ever, with their monotonous cadence (⁴ prognatae vertice pinus,
Neptuni nasse per undas, Argivae robora pubis' lxiv. 1, 2, 4), are
far less effective. The following points of contrast between the
Lucretian and Virgilian hexameter are noted by Munro: (1) the
first two feet separated from the rest—-‘ Religionibus atque minis,
Ergo vivida vis,’ ete.; such rhythms being rare in Virgil (‘ Armen-
tarius Afer' G. iii. 344, ‘ Sed tu desine velle' G. iv. 448); (2) in the
last two feet, such endings as ‘principiorum,' ‘materiai‚' ‘quan- .
doquidem exstat;' (3) elision after the fourth foot—‘Perdelirum
esse videtur, nisi concilio ante coacto 3⁷ (4) fourth foot wholly con-
tained in a word, and ending with it-‘ quae terras frugiferentes,'
‘tibi suaves daedala tellus' (not ‘terras quae . . . suaves tibi ‘),
etc.; (5) copious use of alliteration and assonance‚ occasionally
adopted by Virgil under Lucretian influence.

6. The most common ‘licences' or metrical irregularities in
Virgil are—-

(i.) Lengthening of short final syllables. This occurs only
in arsi (i. e. in the emphatic syllable of a foot, upon which
the metrical ictus falls), and seldom where there is not a pause
