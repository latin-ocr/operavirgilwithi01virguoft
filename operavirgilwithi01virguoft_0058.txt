liv INTRODUCTION.

Since writing the above, I have found welcome support for
some of the views here advocated in the remarks of Prof. Joseph
Β. Mayor prefixed to Vol. i. of his edition of Cicero, ‘De Natura
Deorum' (Cambridge, 1880)1. Looking particularly at the educa-
tional use of Latin classics, he holds that ‘for practical purposes
the best spelling is that which obtrudes itself least, and least
diverts the attention of the reader from the thought of the writer.
In books therefore which are printed for ordinary reading, we
should not seek to reproduce the spelling of a particular age or
of a particular author, except where, as in Chaucer, it may be
needed to show the scansion of a line, but we should endeavour
to give the normal spelling of the language after it had assumed
a fixed and stationary form ⁷-i. e. in the case of Latin, the period
between Nero and Hadrian, the latter half of the first century A. D.
Acting on this principle, Prof. Mayor always gives (1) superl. in
‘—imus,' never ‘-umus 3² (2) ‘u,⁷ not ‘0' after ‘v3' (3) ‘-es,' not
‘-is,' in plur. of ‘i-² declension; (4) assimilated forms, where
possible; (5) the Latin form ‘-em,⁷ rather than Greek ‘-en⁷ for
acc. of Greek nouns in ‘-es 3' (6) ‘di,' ‘dis' not ‘ dei,' ‘ deis‚' ete. 2
and retains ‘ j ' for consonantal ‘i,' and the old-fashioned spelling
of the compounds of ‘iacio’—viz. ‘conjicio,⁷ ‘rejicio,' ‘disjicio,’
etc. (quoting Gell. iv. 17, objecting to the omission of consonantal
‘ i⁷ in such words as confusing versification). He would, however,
allow ‘reice ² Virg. Ecl. iii. 96, ‘adicit ' Mart. x. 82. 1, and similar
cases, where ‘the consonantal “i ⁷² ceases to exercise any influence

on the quantity of the preceding syllable! (See on this question,
Ecl. iii. 96, note.)

IV. THE VIRGILIAN HEXAMETER2.

1. The Latin Hexameter, first adapted from the Greek by En-
nius, and gradually improved by a series of more or less known
poets, reached its highest and final perfectiori with Virgi13 all
subsequent poets being content to follow as nearly as might be

Prof. Mayor and I have arrived independently, and on somewhat different
grounds, be orthodox or heretical, it is (to me at any rate) satisfactory to
fall in with such good company.
