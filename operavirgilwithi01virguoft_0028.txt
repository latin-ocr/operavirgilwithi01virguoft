11. For questions affecting the literary criticism of the poems,
so far as they are not discussed in the NoteS, I must refer students
to Professor Sellar’s volume, to Professor Conington’s Intro-
ductions, and to Professor Nettleship's ‘ Suggestions,⁷ merely
offering a few remarks upon one of the frequent criticisms passed
upon Virgil—that of want of originality. This is the easiest
criticism of all, for the borrowed element lies upon the surface.
The Eclogues reflect—nay, they reproduce Theocritus 3 the Geor-
gics are, as Virgil himself calls them, Ascraeum carmen, a remin-
iscence of Hesiod ; the Aeneid from end to end is full of imitation,
often crude and external enough, of Homer. And so we have
such epigrammatic criticisms as ‘Virgi1''is Homer-and-water,' or
‘ Homer wrote Virgil 3' the latter of which drew from Voltaire the
retort ‘Homere a fait Virgile, dit—on ; si cela est, c’est sans doute
son plus bel ouvrage! Such criticism is easy, but it is also super-
ficial ; for as Prof. N ettleship remarks (‘ Suggestions,’ Preface‚ p.
iii), ‘it is clear that a poet who won the ear of his nation so soon
as Virgil, and became at once one of the most popular poets and
the most classical poet of Rome, could not have gained this position
without great original power.² A poet whose genius could absorb
the admiration of Dante, and whose influence probably helped
more than any other to inform the poetical spirit and verse of
Milton, must have had some wider and more solid qualities than
mere technical skill in versification-something more than the
dignity of expression, exquisite rhythm, and delicate tenderness of
handling, which all allow. ‘Mere rhetorical skill has never made
and can never make a work immortal.' It is in the present
century, more than at any time since the Aeneid appeared, that
Virgil⁷s claim to a foremost place among great poets has been

¹ e. g. ‘ Tu ne cede malis, sed contra audentior ito ’ (Aen. vi. 95); ‘Disce,
puer, virtutem ex me verumque laborem, Fortunam ex aliis;’ ‘Aude, hos-
pes, contemnere opes, et te quoque dignum Finge deo, rebusque veni non
asper egenis’ (viii. 364). However this may be, we may regret that the
words of the ‘chastest poet (as Bacon calls him) and royalest, Virgilius
Maro, that to the memory of man is known ’ are so little heard or appre-
ciated in the modern House of C01nmons; and that modern educational
requirements have rendered difficult, if not impossible, the old-fashioned
thorough knowledge of such a teacher.
