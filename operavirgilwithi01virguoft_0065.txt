JV. THE VJRGJLJAN HEXAMETER. lxi

(sudden irrigation), Aen. x, 101-104 (the hush of all Nature at
Jupiter's word), ib. 821-824 (the revulsion of feeling over a fallen
foe), xii. 951, 952 (the creeping chill of death, followed by the
quick ssight to Hades of the indignant soul). Every reader who
can appreciate poetic rhythm will find others for himself. The
greatness of Virgil's rhythm, its undefinable charm and pathos, its
power to touch the hidden chords of human feeling, are beyond
disput'e : and though familiar association with particular lines and
passages may invest them with the expression of more than the
poet’s thought, such capacity of adaptation to new feelings is one
more testimony to their inherent poetry. Professor Sellar ¹, in the
appreciative criticism which closes his volume on Virgil, cites ap-
propriately the remarks of ‘one of the greatest masters of expres-
sion among living English writers ⁷ (Cardinal Newman) upon the
power of Virgil’s ‘single words and phrases, his pathetic half-lines
giving utterance, as the voice of Nature herself, to that pain and
weariness yet hope of better things which is the experience of her
children in every time! And Mr. Myers, to the poetic insight of
whose criticism on Virgil I have already referred2‚ thus happily
generalises the impressions produced by Virgil's style:

‘What is meant by the vague praise so often bestowed on
Virgil⁷s unequalled style is practically this, that he has been, per-
haps, more successful than any other poet in fusing together the
expressed and the suggested emotion 3 that he has discovered the
hidden music which can give to every shade of feeling its distinc-
tion, its permanence, and its charm3 that his thoughts seem to
come to us on the wings of melodies prepared for them from the
foundation of the world³.'
