I. LIFE ΛΝΒ POEMS OF VIRGIL. xxiii

the present century, establishes Virgil's claim to be reckoned
among the great poets of the world. It is ‘as great a fortune as
that which has ever fallen to the lot of any writer1'—not excepting
Homer himself. For though to Homer it was given to influence
the whole intellectual development of Greece, and through Greece
the civilised world, while his poems retain the undying freshness
of an originality which springs but once into being ; yet the sphere
of Virgil has in some respects been wider still, inasmuch as the
period of his ascendancy in literature, in education‚ and in politics
has been marked by more important developments, and fruitful of
greater issues than even the golden age of Greece. He is the
exponent of that spirit of Roman ascendancy and that far-reaching
grasp of Roman civilisaffion, which has left its mark all over
modern Europe; so that it has been truly observed that neither
in law, nor in politics, nor in literature, nor in society, can we ever
escape from the shadow of the Seven Hills. The majestic sweep
of Virgil’s rhythm‚ the ‘ stately metrical roll which reflects the
pomp and pride of the imperial city,' the magical charm of a
music which can be felt rather than described, the power of
language which touches the noblest and deepest feelings of the
heart, and stamps in clear-cut phrases the associations and the
thoughts of every mood of man—all this has given Virgil a hold
upon men's minds which is simple matter of history. ‘No poet
<says Mr. Myers) has lain so close to so many hearts; no words
so often as his have sprung to men's lips in moments of excitement
and sels-revelation, from the one fierce line² retained and chanted
by the untameable boy who was to be Emperor of Rome, to the
impassioned prophecy of the great English statesman3 as he
pleaded till morning's light for the freedom of a continent of
slaves.' Prof. Sellar expresses another side of the same truth
when he points out (‘Virgil‚' p. 412) that ‘the words of no other
poet, ancient or modern, have been so often heard in the great
debates of the English Parliament‚ which more than any other
deliberations among men¹ have reproduced the dignified and
masculine eloquence familiar to the Roman Senate:’ or when
he suggests (p. 68) that the importance long attached to Virgil
in English public schools, and the turning over in early life, as
