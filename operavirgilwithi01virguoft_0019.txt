I. LIFE AND POEMS OF VIRGIL. XV

Et vos, Stssoque, Tarquitique, Vanoque,

Scholasticorum natio madens pingui . . . .

Nos ad beatos vela mittimus portus,

Magni petentes docta dicta Sironis,

Vitamque ab omni vindicabimus cura.

Ite hinc, Camenae, vos quoque ite iam, sane

Dulces Camenae, nam, fatebimur verum,

Dulees suistis; et tamen meas chartas

Revisitote, sed pudenter et raro.’

Like Lucretius, he hopes to find in philosophy an ideal serenity of
life (cp. G. ii. 49od492) ; but the last four lines show that the desire
of his heart and the bent of his genius are for poetry—the ‘ dulces
ante omnia Musae' (ib. 475), to whom his life was to be devoted.
Traces, however, of the early longing for philosophy, here first
expressed by him, and never altogether forgotten, appear aster-
wards in such passages as the song of Silenus in Ecl. νίς G. ii.
477 sqq.; the song of Iopas, Aen. i. 742-746; and the exposition
of the ‘Anima Mundi’ vi. 724 sqq. (See notes ad loca).

Of the four other poems assigned to Virgil, the ‘Moretum³
(Salad) and ‘Copa' (Hostess) might be, but are not proved to be,
productions of his boyhood: while the ‘Culex' (Gnat) and ‘Ciris’
(? Woodpecker) are now generally recognised as not by him, despite
the tradition as to the former vouched foriby Suetonius.

3. How long Virgil remained at Rome is uncertain. We find
him in 4317320, livi-ng athlantua and engaged on the Eclogues ; and
it is probable that the outbreak of the Civil XVar in 49 B. C. would
have interrupted his stay in the capital. During this period he
must have learned to admire the writings of Lucretius, of the epic
poet Varius, and of the tragedian and historian Asinius Pollio:
and Suetonius tells us that he began a poem on the history of
Rome, after the example of Ennius and other early poets—a
statement borne out by Virgil himself in Ecl. vi. 2-5. We gather
also that Varus (Ecl. vi. 6-12> and Pollio (Ecl. viii. 6 sqq.) pressed
him to give a poetical account of their own and Caesar's exploits ;
but that for the time he put all such work aside for the sake of
pastoral poetry. It is, however, noticeable‚ as Professor Sellar
points out¹‚ that afterwards in the ‘Aeneid' he combined the
revival of ancient traditions about the origin of Rome and the
celebration of the great deeds of his own time. It is by the
capacity ‘of forecasting some great work, and dwelling on the
