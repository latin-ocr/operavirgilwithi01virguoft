PREFACE. ix

expunge ‘Virgilio' from the text of Dante; or when English-
men brand as illegitimate such Anglicised names as ‘Horace,'
‘Livy‚' ‘Athens,’ or ‘Rome ;' then, Ι think, it will be time to
insist upon the universal adoption of ‘VergiL'

Ι should add that the greater part of the Introduction was
written, and in type, before Ι had seen Vol. I of the new
edition of Professor Conington’s virgil, with additional intro-
ductory matter by Professor Nettleship: and it did not seem
then worth while to omit anything for which, perhaps, a simple
reference to what Professor Nettleship has written would have
been sufficient.

I have reserved to the last the mention of my special obli-
gations to the Venerable Edwin Palmer‚ D.D., Archdeacon of
Oxford and Canon of Christ Church, formerly Fellow and
Tutor of Balliol College. Like many old Balliol men, Ι recall
his lectures on Virgil as a real stimulus to scholarship, and as
the foundation of any Virgilian learning that Ι possess: and he
has now crowned the uninterrupted kindness of twenty years'
friendship, by placing at my disposal, for the preparation of
this edition, the MS. notes which he used for his lectures.
Where these notes are incorporated verbatim with my own, the
letters [E. P.] will be found appended: but my obligation to
them throughout is beyond adequate acknowledgment.
