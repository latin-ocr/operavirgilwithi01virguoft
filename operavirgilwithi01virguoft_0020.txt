xvi INTRODUCTION.

idea till it clears itself of all alien matter, and assimilates to itself
the impressions and interests of a life-time, that the vastest and
most enduring monuments of genius are produced :’—such, for
example, as the ‘Aeneid,' the ‘Paradise Lost,' and the ‘Divina
Commedia.’

4. In the year 41 B.C. occurred the ejection of Virgil from his
paternal farm by one of the soldiers to whom the Triumvirs
Antonius, Octavianus, and Lepidus had assigned grants of land
in Cisalpine Gaul. Opinions differ, according to the view taken
of the relative date and connection of Eclogues i. and ix, as to
whether Virgil was once or twice dispossessed. Ι have followed
Prof. Nettleship1 in regarding Ecl. ix. as the earlier poem, referring
to the first and only ejection of the poet ; who then seems to have
appealed in person to Octavianus at Rome, backed by Varus
(addressed in Ecl. ix), Pollio and Gallus, then holding important
posts in Gallia Cisalpina, and to have obtained the restitution of
his lands. In gratitude to these friends, some three years after-
wards, he published the Eclogues in their honour 3 Ecl. i. being a
thankoffering to Octavianus for his restoration, and Ecl. vi.
(perhaps) a mark of gratitude to Varus, while Ecl. iv. and viii. are
complimentary to Pollio, and Ecl. x. to Gallus.

The composition of the Eclogues falls between the years 43—37
B.C. inclusive (Virg. aet. 27—33). No date can be assigned to
Ecl. vii 3 ii. and iii. must have been written before v, and v. before
ix (see notes) ; iii. speaks of Pollio as encouraging the poet, and
an old tradition referred ii. to a boy given him by Pollio; so
possibly one or both of these may have been written in 43 B. C.‚
the year of Pollio's appointment as ‘legatus' in Cisalpine Gaul.
Ecl. v. probably alludes to the apotheosis of Julius Caesar, and
may have been written 43-41 B. C.; ix. being written (as stated
above) in 41, i, iv, and possibly vi, in 40, and viii. in 39 Β. C., the
year of Pollio's return in triumph from Illyria. Ecl. x, written in
37 B.C.‚ the year when Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa crossed the
Rhine, closes the series.

Propertius seems to speak of Ecl. vii. as written near Tarentum ε

‘Tu canis umbrosi subter pineta Galaesi
Thyrsin et attritis Daphnin harundinibus’ (iii. 26. 67);

and Virgil himself (G. iv. 125 sqq.) has a reminiscence of that
neighbourhood. Horace in the ‘Journey to Brundisium⁷ (Sat. i.
5. 40) 37 B.C. says, that Virgil joined the party at Sinuessa. And
