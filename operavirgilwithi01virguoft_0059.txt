IV. THE VIRGILIAN HEXAMETER. lv

the Virgilian model. The characteristic features of that model
are best seen in contrast with the previous efforts of the chief
poets that employed this metre—viZ. Ennius, Lucretius, and
Catullus.

2. The Hexameter is in technical language a ‘Dactylic Hexa-
meter Catalectic‚’ the last foot losing its· final syllable: and con—
sists therefore of five dactyls and a trochee (- υ). Each dactyl
(-· uu) is equivalent to a spondee (--)‚ for υυε- ; and in the
first four feet, dactyls and spondees are used indifferenssy, the
former being more numerous in Greek, the latter in Latin. The
fifth foot is almost always a dactyl‚ perhaps to mark clearly the
dactylic character of the verse. The last foot may be trochee or
spondee, the quantity of the final syllable being indifferent (except
where, as in Greek anapaests‚ the scansion runs on from verse to
verse by ‘synaphea'): but it is probable that Latin poets‚ from
Ennius downwards‚ regarded it as a real spondee. The rhythm
and harmony of a hexameter verse depend mainly upon ‘Cae-
sura¹,’ i.e. the coincidence somewhere in the second, third, fourth
or fifth feet of the end of a word with the middle of a foot : and
the metrical effect of a series of hexameter verses depends on the
judicious variation (Ι) of caesura, (2) of the proportion of dactyls
and spondees, (3) of the place in the verse at which the pauses in
sense occur, (4) on the cadence of the verse in the last two feet.
It is in the care bestowed on these points that Virgil’s rhythmis
chiefly distinguished from that of Ennius and Lucretius. In the
fifth and sixth feet he employs‚ as a ναῖε, only two varieties of
rhythm, (1) the fifth foot (dactyl) contained in one word and end-

The most important caesura is (b), which is sufficient to make a verse
harmonious—e. g. ‘ Illius immensae l ruperunt horrea messes,⁷
