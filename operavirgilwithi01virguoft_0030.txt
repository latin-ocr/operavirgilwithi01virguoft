XXVI JNTRODUCTJON.

Homer ; Lucretius, Ennius : few pages of Ovid (to say nothing of
later poets) are free from imitations of Virgil. Even the Greek
poets, free and spontaneous as they are, draw largely upon Ho-
meric ideas, and even upon Homeric phrases : a Roman poet, who
owed to Greece the whole awakening of his spiritual life, would
have considered it little short of madness to desert the Greek
models. The only great presentment of heroic times open to
Virgil was that of the Homeric poems; it would have seemed
impossible for him to cast his epic in any mould but in that
of the Iliad and Odyssey. To reproduce their form in Roman
outline, use their details, absorb their spirit, surpass if possible
their effect, would be his first and most natural ambition.' This
is fully borne out by the history of Roman literature, and by the

language of the Roman poets themselves : eg. by Lucretius' praise
of Ennius (i. 117)—

‘Ennius ut noster cecinit, qui primus amoeno
Detulit ex Helicone perenni fronde coronam z'

by Virgil's own expression of his poetical ambition (G. iii. 10)-

‘Primus ego in patriam mecum, modo vita supersit,
Aonio rediens deducam vertice Musasz'

by Horace's estimate of his title to lyric fame—-

‘Dicar . . . ex humili potens
Princeps Aeolium carmen ad Italos
Deduxisse modos ' (od. iii. 30. 10).

‘Parios ego primus iambos
Ostendi Latio, numeros animosque secutus
Archilochi⁷ (Epp. i. 19. 23):

or by his canon of the conditions for success in poetry (A. P. 268)—

‘Vos exemplaria Graeca
Nocturna versate manu, versate diurna.’

13. Virgil has also, in common with Horace, incurred the re-
proach of undue servility and courtly fiattery, shown especially in
the language which each uses in speaking of Augustus. That
‘tasteless falsehood,' the worship of the Emperor, which meets us
as an established cultus in the pages of Tacitus ¹, must no doubt
have received an impulse from the panegyric of the great Augustan
poets: and from a modern point of view, it is difficult to acquit
them of at least want of taste‚ if not of actual hypocrisy. Here
again, however, we must go back to the literary conditions and
